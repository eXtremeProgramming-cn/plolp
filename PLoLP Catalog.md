## Organizing Prompts
*   **Long Prompt**
    *   Using prompts longer than 1000 words significantly improves the effectiveness of LLM.
*   **Prompt File**
    *   Putting prompts into files (e.g. docx files) instead of typing them directly in chatboxes, it is the foundation of all other advanced techniques and patterns.
*   **Chapter**
    *   A prompt should be organized as multiple chapters (as well as attachments), for easier structure and reuse.

## Defining Task
*   **Problem Orientation**
    *   Frame your challenge from high level, to make a boundary of targeted goal of the prompt.
*   **Prescribed Process**
    *   Outline the specific steps, to ensure thoroughness and adherence to a required workflow.
*   **Example**
    *   Give concrete examples of input and output in complex steps, to reduce confusion.

## Setting Context and Role
*   **Persona Adoption**
    *   Ask LLM to play a role, to frame its thinking.
*   **Audience**
    *   Profile the audience, to indicate the LLM to communicate with the audience with proper information and language style.
*   **Epistemology Frame**
    *   Describe ideology, philosophy, world view and methodology which LLM should follow. It shapes LLM's thinking process implicitly and deeply.

## Structuring Input
*	**Exhaustive Input**
	*	Try to input as much information as possible. The large context LLM has, the better it performs the given task.
*   **Online Search**
    *   Request LLM to outreach online information to supplement the research.
*   **Attachment**
    *   Attach files to prompt as references. It also creates reusable modules.
*   **Relevance**
    *   When offering input information (either as inline text, attachment, or online search), always clarify the usage of the input item - on what aspect this input is relevant (or irrelevant) to the current task.

## Shaping Output
*   **Structured Output**
    *   Specify expected structure of output, such as introduction, conclusion, etc., and specify need for each section individually.
*   **Style Mimicry**
    *   Give sample documents for LLM to mimic structure and language style.
*   **Formatting Constraints**
    *   Spell out explicit instructions for the desired output format and content boundaries, such as length and format (bullet points, an outline, a table, a diagram), etc.
*   **Deconstruction**
    *   Use LLM to deconstruct and reverse engineer existing artifacts, to explicitify its methodology, structure, writing style, etc.

## Sharpening Your Mind
*   **Trial and Error**
    *   Always be brave to try various things and make mistakes. Don't stick with something "more or less working".
*   **Iteration**
    *   Always learn from mistakes and improve with intention. Don't try things randomly.
*   **Decomposition**
    *   Always decompose your task into smaller subtasks, and consider MECE principle while doing so.
*   **Precision**
    *   Use precise language. Give clear instructions. Refer to entities without ambiguity. Use glossary and numbering systems for consistency.
*	**Brainstorm**
	*	Always invite LLM to think through your challenge from multiple perspectives. Discuss with it and consolidate your thoughts.
*	**Criticism**
	*	Always ask LLM to criticize and improve your work from various angles.
