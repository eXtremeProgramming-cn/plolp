Okay, let's refine your prompt based on the principles in the provided document. Here's a breakdown of suggestions and how to apply them:

**1. Prompt Length and Detail**

  * **Current Issue:** Your prompt is relatively short.
  * **Solution:** Expand it significantly. Provide much more detail about the book, the desired style, and the expected output. Aim for a prompt that could be 1000+ words if necessary[cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
  * **Example additions:**
      * Describe the intended audience of "Pattern Language of LLM Prompting."
      * Specify the structure you envision for the book (e.g., introduction, chapters, sections, subsections, conclusion, appendix).
      * Elaborate on the specific aspects of Martin Fowler's "Refactoring" style you want to emulate (e.g., tone, use of examples, explanations, etc.).
      * Give examples of patterns you want the LLM to generate.

**2. Prompt Format**

  * **Current Issue:** You've presented the prompt in a structured format, which is good, but it's likely you are writing this directly in the chat.
  * **Solution:** Write the prompt in a separate file (e.g., .txt or .docx)[cite: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. This allows for easier editing, version control, and the ability to attach it.
  * **Reasoning:** You can iteratively improve the prompt in the file[cite: 13, 14].

**3. Prompt Structure**

  * **Current Issue:** The prompt has some structure, but it can be enhanced for a complex task like book writing.
  * **Solution:** Divide the prompt into "chapters" or sections[cite: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
  * **Example:**
      * Chapter 1: Define the book's purpose, target audience, and overall structure.
      * Chapter 2: Detail the desired writing style, providing examples from "Refactoring."
      * Chapter 3: Specify the format for each pattern description (problem, context, solution, etc.).
      * Chapter 4: Give examples of specific patterns you want the LLM to generate.
  * **Reasoning:** This will help the LLM stay organized and focused[cite: 18, 19, 20].

**4. Task Definition**

  * **Current Issue:** The "How to achieve this goal?" section is a bit vague.
  * **Solution:**
      * **Problem Orientation:** Start by clearly stating the problem you're trying to solve (e.g., "Writing a comprehensive and useful book on LLM prompting patterns is challenging due to the complexity and novelty of the subject matter.")[cite: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].
      * **Prescribed Process:** Outline the steps you want the LLM to take[cite: 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]:
          * "1. Analyze the writing style of the attached book \<Refactoring\>."
          * "2. Identify the key elements that define this style (e.g., tone, structure, use of examples)."
          * "3.  Develop a template for describing LLM prompting patterns, including sections for Problem, Context, Solution, Examples, and Benefits."
          * "4. Generate content for the first 3 patterns..."
      * **Example:** Provide an example of a pattern formatted according to your template[cite: 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42].

**5. Context and Role**

  * **Solution:**
      * **Persona Adoption:** Assign a persona to the LLM[cite: 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]. For example, "You are a highly experienced technical writer and software engineer, specializing in documenting complex systems and patterns. You are an expert at explaining technical concepts clearly and concisely."
      * **Audience:** Clearly define the target audience for the book[cite: 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57].
      * **Epistemology Frame:** If applicable, provide a guiding philosophy (e.g., "Focus on practical utility and evidence-based recommendations.")[cite: 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65].

**6. Input Structuring**

  * **Solution:**
      * **Exhaustive Input:** The more information you give, the better[cite: 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73]. Include detailed descriptions, examples, and constraints.
      * **Attachment:** Definitely attach the "Refactoring" book[cite: 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89].
      * **Relevance:** For each part of the input, explain why it's included and how the LLM should use it[cite: 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98].

**7. Output Shaping**

  * **Solution:**
      * **Structured Output:** Specify the exact structure for the book and for each pattern[cite: 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106].
      * **Style Mimicry:** Refer to the attached "Refactoring" book and give explicit instructions on what to mimic[cite: 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114].
      * **Formatting Constraints:** Set constraints on length, format (e.g., bullet points, tables), tone, etc.[cite: 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122].
      * **Deconstruction:** You can have the LLM analyze sections of "Refactoring" to explain the writing style, and then use that analysis to inform its writing[cite: 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130].

**8. Sharpening Your Mind**

  * **Solution:**
      * **Trial and Error:** Be prepared to experiment and refine your prompt[cite: 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137].
      * **Iteration:** Intentionally iterate based on the LLM's output, analyzing what works and what doesn't[cite: 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144].
      * **Decomposition:** Break down the book writing into smaller, manageable tasks[cite: 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152].
      * **Precision:** Use clear, unambiguous language[cite: 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162].
      * **Brainstorm:** Use the LLM to brainstorm pattern ideas[cite: 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171].
      * **Criticism:** Ask the LLM to critique its own output and suggest improvements[cite: 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178].

By applying these principles, you can transform your initial prompt into a much more effective tool for guiding the LLM in writing your book.
