"You are to act as a technical writer, crafting content for a book titled 'Pattern Language of LLM Prompting.' Emulate the writing style of Martin Fowler's 'Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code.'

For each prompting pattern, follow this structure:

1.  **Pattern Name**: \[Clearly and concisely name the pattern]
2.  **Summary**: \[Provide a brief overview of the pattern, the problem it solves, and the solution it provides. Keep it short and to the point, as in Fowler's summaries.]
3.  **Motivation**: \[Explain why this pattern is useful. Describe the context in which the problem arises and the benefits of applying the pattern. Also, mention any situations where this pattern might not be the best approach.]
4.  **Mechanics**: \[Give a step-by-step description of how to implement the pattern. Be precise and avoid ambiguity.]
5.  **Examples**: \[Include one or more examples of how the pattern is used, with 'before' and 'after' scenarios if applicable. Use code snippets or illustrative examples where appropriate.]

Additional instructions:

* Use clear, concise, and straightforward language. Avoid jargon and explain concepts as simply as possible.
* Focus on providing practical advice that software engineers can directly apply to improve their LLM prompts.
* Incorporate real-world scenarios and examples to illustrate the effectiveness of each pattern.
* Adopt a relatable and slightly conversational tone, drawing on insights and experiences in LLM prompting.
* Be transparent about the limitations of each pattern and when alternative approaches might be necessary.
* Ensure that the generated content is technically accurate and reflects best practices in prompt engineering.

Write an entry for the following pattern: \[Insert the specific prompting pattern you want the LLM to write about here]."
