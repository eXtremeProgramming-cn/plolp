### Audience
Define the audience so the LLM can adjust content and tone.

**Motivation:** If the intended audience for the output isn't specified, the LLM has to guess the appropriate level of detail and tone. It might produce text that is too technical for a general reader or too simplistic for an expert. Without knowing the audience, the content can easily miss the mark.

**Solution:** Clearly describe the target audience in your prompt. Explain who will be reading the answer and note their background or expertise level. This allows the LLM to tailor its language, depth of explanation, and tone to match the audience's needs. For example, you might instruct, "Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of this topic," or "This answer will be reviewed by experienced professionals in the field," depending on the case.
