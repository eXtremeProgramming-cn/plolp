### Chapter
Organize prompts into chapters for better structure and reuse.

**Motivation:** For lengthy or multi-part instructions, presenting everything in one big block can overwhelm the LLM and the user. Without clear divisions (chapters or sections), the prompt may lack logical flow, making it difficult for the model to follow and for you to maintain. Important context or instructions might be buried or overlooked when the structure isn't clear.

**Solution:** Divide your prompt into multiple titled sections or "chapters," each focusing on a specific aspect of the task. This structure provides a clear roadmap for the LLM to follow and ensures the LLM processes information in a logical order. It also helps you manage the content: you can update or reuse individual chapters (or attach separate documents as chapters) instead of dealing with one large, monolithic prompt.
