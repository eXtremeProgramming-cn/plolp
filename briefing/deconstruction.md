### Deconstruction
Use the LLM to deconstruct examples and reveal their structure and style.

**Motivation:** It can be challenging to replicate a good example or learn its technique just by observation. The LLM might imitate surface features of an example without truly understanding the underlying structure or method. If neither you nor the model analyze the example, important patterns or reasoning steps in that example may remain hidden, leading to weaker results when you attempt something similar.

**Solution:** Have the LLM analyze and break down an example step by step. In your prompt, ask the model to explain how a given piece of writing or solution is constructed (for instance, "Explain the structure and approach used in the above example"). By getting the LLM to reverse-engineer the example, it will make implicit elements explicit â€” identifying the methodology, structure, and style used. This understanding can then guide the LLM (and you) in creating new content that follows the same successful pattern, since you now know the "recipe" behind the example.
