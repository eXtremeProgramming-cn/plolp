### Example
Provide concrete examples for complex steps to avoid confusion.

**Motivation:** For complex or abstract tasks, just giving instructions might not be enough for the LLM to understand exactly what's expected. If no examples are provided, the model could misinterpret the format or level of detail required. This can cause confusion and result in outputs that don't meet your needs (for instance, using a different format than you intended).

**Solution:** Include concrete examples within your prompt to illustrate what you want. For instance, show a sample input and the desired output for a key step. By demonstrating the correct format or outcome with an example, you reduce ambiguity and help the LLM follow your intentions more closely.
