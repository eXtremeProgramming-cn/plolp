### Long Prompt
Use long prompts (1000+ words) for better results.

**Motivation:** Short or overly brief prompts may not provide the LLM with enough context or detail. The model can misunderstand the task or skip important details when the prompt is not comprehensive. This often leads to outputs that are shallow, generic, or missing critical information.

**Solution:** Make your prompt significantly longer and more detailed. Include extensive background information, context, and explicit instructions (often pushing the prompt to 1000 words or more) so the LLM fully understands the task. With ample context, the LLM can produce a much more thorough and accurate response.
