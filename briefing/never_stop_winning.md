### Never Stop Winning
Don't fear experimenting or making mistakes; never settle for "good enough."

**Motivation:** Users often stick with the first prompt that yields an acceptable answer, even if it's not perfect. There can be a reluctance to try new approaches once something "mostly works," due to fear of failure or wasting time. However, this means missing out on potentially better solutions â€” if you never experiment further, you won't discover if a different tactic could produce a significantly better result.

**Solution:** Embrace an experimental approach to prompting. Try different ways of asking your question or structuring your prompt, even if some attempts fail or produce worse answers. Treat each prompt attempt as a learning opportunity: when something doesn't work well, figure out why and change your approach. By iterating through trial and error, you can stumble upon more effective techniques and eventually improve the output beyond what the first "good enough" prompt achieved.

**Explanations:** 

IMPORTANT NOTE: I want this chapter to be mentally encouraging and inspiring. Doesn't have to be long. Doesn't have to have many convincing examples. This chapter talks spiritually, not logically.

In the "Challenge" part: actually there are two types of challenges I (the author) see

1. some people try a little bit using LLM, with very simple (often less than 6 sentences) prompts try to perform some task, and take whatever LLM gives and edit it to make it "more or less work"
2. some other people try to think about how to make a sophisticated prompt from the beginning - they can think so much that they haven't had any experiment in a week

There is some psycological reason - most people are afraid of making mistakes. And in physical world making mistakes often cause costs and consequences. (Mind tonality. Let's don't be rude to those muggles.) 

But digital world is where you can make a lot of mistakes with little cost - in the case of LLM, since I have already paid monthly subscription fee, the only cost of a trial and error is just a few minutes time. So, why not trying?

IMPORTANT POINT: I (the author) believe the word "mistake", or "trial and error", gives people a negative feeling. Even though we always encourage "trail and error", but mentally very rare people like "error". 

(NOTE: I want to emphasize this idea is from Donald Trump, the President of the USA - he is so obssessed to "Win" everyday, it is actually a very positive mindset. We can learn from even Trump, such a horrible person.)

Therefore, we should treat every attempt of trying and/or improving prompt as a "WIN" of the user:

* Typing one simple sentence and ask the LLM to do something is a WIN. LLM gives you something, even though not perfect, but now you have a better sense what to improve - with nearly no cost.
* Saving prompt to a file is a WIN. Now you can share your prompt to someone else and get feedback and collaborate.
* Making any change to the prompt and try it again is a WIN. You can learn something works or something doesn't work. You know more about LLM.
* Applying any pattern of this book is a BIG WIN. You are applying something already proven to be effective to solve a particular problem. - Let's use "Attachment" pattern as an example, because attaching another file to a prompt is pretty counter-intuitive, therefore start doing so must be a BIG WIN.

The only wrong thing a user can do with LLM, is STOP WINNING - i.e. stop trying new things, stop improving a prompt, settle with something "mostly works" knowing it is not perfect.
