### Persona Adoption
Give the LLM a persona to guide its responses.

**Motivation:** The LLM's default persona is often neutral and generic, lacking the specific perspective or expertise needed for a specialized task. Without a defined role, its responses may be too general and not aligned with the tone or depth you require.

**Solution:** Explicitly define a persona for the LLM at the start of the prompt. Include details such as:  
- **Role or title:** The role or job title you want it to assume (e.g., "a university history professor").  
- **Expertise:** The area of expertise or domain knowledge it should have (e.g., "with expertise in international relations and digital sovereignty").  
- **Ideology or viewpoint:** Any key beliefs or ideological stance (e.g., "a patriot with Marxist leanings who believes internationalism can align with national interest").  
- **Contextual info:** Relevant background or context that comes with that persona (e.g., "familiar with governmental sensitivities and the target audience's expectations").
