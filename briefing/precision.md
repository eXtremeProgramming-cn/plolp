### Precision
Use precise language, clear instructions, and unambiguous references for consistency.

**Motivation:** Imprecise prompts can lead to the LLM misunderstanding what you want. If your wording is vague or if you refer to something inconsistently (using different names for the same concept, for example), the model can become confused. Ambiguity or lack of clarity often results in answers that are off-target or contain errors, because the model had to guess your intent or which details mattered.

**Solution:** Craft your prompt with clarity and consistency in mind:  
- **Specific wording:** Use exact terms for what you mean; avoid vague language or open-ended phrases that could be interpreted multiple ways.  
- **Clear instructions:** If you have multiple instructions or questions, list them in a structured way (like a numbered list) so none are overlooked.  
- **Consistent references:** Always refer to important entities or concepts by the same name or descriptor throughout the prompt. If necessary, define them explicitly.  
- **No ambiguity:** If something might be unclear, add a brief clarification. It's better to slightly over-explain in the prompt than to leave the model guessing.
