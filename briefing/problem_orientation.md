### Problem Orientation
Start with the big picture to clarify the prompt's goal.

**Motivation:** Asking the LLM to perform a task without first explaining the overall problem can lead to unfocused or off-target results. If the prompt dives into details without context, the model might not understand what the real objective is or which aspects are most important. This can result in responses that wander off topic or fail to address the core issue.

**Solution:** Begin the prompt by describing the challenge in broad terms and outlining the desired outcome. Provide the high-level context and goals before getting into specifics. By establishing this "big picture" first, you create a clear target for the LLM, helping it align its answers with the overall objective.
