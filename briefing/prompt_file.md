### Prompt File
Use files for prompts instead of chat boxes to enable advanced techniques.

**Motivation:** Crafting complex prompts directly in a chat box can be cumbersome and disorganized. Without saving prompts to a file, it's harder to revise or reuse them, and you might lose track of changes or versions. Additionally, some advanced prompt strategies (like adding attachments or iterative editing) are not feasible when everything is done inline in a chat.

**Solution:** Compose prompts in a separate file (such as a Word document or text file) rather than typing them only in the chat interface. A file-based prompt can be easily edited, saved, and reused. This practice creates a foundation for more advanced techniques (like modular prompts or sharing prompt templates), since you have a persistent record of the prompt that you can refine over time.
