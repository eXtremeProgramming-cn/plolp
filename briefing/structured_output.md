### Structured Output
Specify the output structure and content for each section.

**Motivation:** If you don't specify the structure of the desired output, the LLM might return information in a format that doesn't suit your needs. You could get a single long narrative when you actually wanted a structured report with sections, or the response might omit components you were expecting (like an introduction or a summary). Lack of structure can make the output harder to follow or require significant editing to fit your intended use.

**Solution:** Clearly outline the structure you expect in the response. For example, you can tell the LLM that the answer should have an introduction, several specific sections (naming them), and a conclusion. You might also describe what each section should contain (e.g., "Introduction: provide a brief overview of the issue..."). By giving the model an explicit format or template to follow, you ensure that the output is organized and complete in the way you want.

**Explanations:** 

The "Challenge" part can be brief. It is very easy to see why lacking structure is problematic, no need for too much explanation. 

We should remind the reader: "structures" can be beyond text. Users can request LLM to output as CSV or PSV (pipe separated values), so the output can be imported directly to Excel for further analysis or charting.

We should have 2 examples:

1. the prompt to write chapters of this book (should be named as "0. Prompt to Write One Pattern vx.y.docx"): it clearly specified output structure of each chapter - each pattern should have a punchline, motivation, solution, challenge, and example. By specifying the structure, Markdown text generated by LLM can be used as chapters nearly need no manual modification.

2. A simple case generates CSV - for example, population and GDP of all African countries, as a table.

Another trick is: user can extract (or "reverse engineer") a structure from an existing artefact (report, article, spreadsheet, etc.) with LLM's assistance. We will discuss this trick further in a later pattern "Deconstruction". Here we can briefly mention it without more explanation.
