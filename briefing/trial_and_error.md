### Trial and Error
Don't fear experimenting or making mistakes; never settle for "good enough."

**Motivation:** Users often stick with the first prompt that yields an acceptable answer, even if it's not perfect. There can be a reluctance to try new approaches once something "mostly works," due to fear of failure or wasting time. However, this means missing out on potentially better solutions â€” if you never experiment further, you won't discover if a different tactic could produce a significantly better result.

**Solution:** Embrace an experimental approach to prompting. Try different ways of asking your question or structuring your prompt, even if some attempts fail or produce worse answers. Treat each prompt attempt as a learning opportunity: when something doesn't work well, figure out why and change your approach. By iterating through trial and error, you can stumble upon more effective techniques and eventually improve the output beyond what the first "good enough" prompt achieved.
