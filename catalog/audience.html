<p><em>Define the audience so the LLM can adjust content and tone.</em></p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>If the intended audience for the output isn&apos;t specified, the LLM has to guess the appropriate level of detail and tone. It might produce text that is too technical for a general reader or too simplistic for an expert. Without knowing the audience, the content can easily miss the mark.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Clearly describe the target audience in your prompt. Explain who will be reading the answer and note their background or expertise level. This allows the LLM to tailor its language, depth of explanation, and tone to match the audience&apos;s needs. For example, you might instruct, &quot;Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of this topic,&quot; or &quot;This answer will be reviewed by experienced professionals in the field,&quot; depending on the case.</p>
<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
<p>Have you ever asked a question to an AI assistant and gotten an answer that was way over your head? Or perhaps it explained things so simply that it felt condescending or unhelpful? This kind of mismatch is common when the <strong>intended audience</strong> for the answer isn&apos;t made clear in your prompt. In human communication, knowing your audience is key &#x2014; you wouldn&apos;t explain a policy brief to a child the same way you would to a colleague. We naturally adjust our language and tone depending on who we&apos;re addressing. An AI can do the same <em>if</em> you tell it who the readers are. But if you don&apos;t give that guidance, the AI has no choice but to guess. And often, it guesses wrong or just defaults to a bland, generic style. It might assume you&apos;re an expert and unleash a flurry of jargon, or assume you&apos;re a novice and over-explain the basics. Either way, the content misses the mark and leaves you dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Consider a scenario: a community health worker wants to include a short article about flu vaccines in a local newsletter. She types a straightforward prompt to an LLM: &quot;Explain how the flu vaccine works and why it&apos;s important.&quot; The LLM diligently produces a response, and on the surface it sounds informative. But as she reads it, she realizes it&apos;s full of medical terms like &quot;antigens,&quot; &quot;immune response,&quot; and &quot;herd immunity,&quot; and it has a dry, academic tone. It reads a bit like a textbook &#x2013; factual, but not engaging. Most of her neighbors, who don&apos;t have a medical background, would struggle to get through it or find it relatable. In short, the draft is <strong>too technical</strong> for the intended readers. To use it in the newsletter, she would have to spend a lot of time translating that jargon into plain language so the community can understand.</p>
<p>Now imagine the reverse problem. A legal analyst asks an LLM to summarize a new data privacy regulation. He doesn&apos;t specify who the summary is for, just &quot;Summarize the XYZ data privacy law.&quot; The AI, aiming to be accessible to anyone, produces a very simplified overview: it explains the law in general terms that a layperson might understand. That sounds fine at first glance, but this analyst was already familiar with the basics &#x2013; he actually wanted the nuanced implications for legal practice. Because he never mentioned his audience (in this case, himself and his legally savvy colleagues), the LLM played it safe and delivered a <strong>too simplistic</strong> answer. It left out the fine points he was looking for, like specific legal obligations and edge-case scenarios. The analyst finds himself thinking, <em>&quot;This barely scratches the surface of what I need.&quot;</em> Meanwhile, our health worker is wondering, <em>&quot;Who is this explanation for, a medical journal?&quot;</em> Both users got responses that missed the mark.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, the root issue is the same: the model wasn&apos;t told <strong>who the audience is</strong> supposed to be. When the audience is unspecified, the LLM has to make assumptions. Often it will default to a middle-of-the-road approach &#x2014; trying to be not too technical, not too simple, just <em>average</em>. Sometimes it might lean toward explaining things from square one (to avoid confusing anyone); other times it might lean on technical language if the topic itself sounds specialized. These guesses are rarely on target. The content ends up not fully satisfying anyone. For a specialist, it lacks depth or sophistication; for a non-expert, it&apos;s overwhelming or just plain dull.</p>
<p>Without clear audience guidance, an LLM&apos;s response can suffer in several common ways:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrong level of detail:</strong> The answer may dive into more complexity than the reader can handle or, conversely, stay too superficial when the reader actually needs depth. In our examples, the community newsletter got a needlessly complex explanation, while the legal expert got an oversimplified summary.  </li>
<li><strong>Inappropriate tone:</strong> The tone might be too formal, too casual, or otherwise off-key. Imagine asking for a note intended for high school students but getting something that reads like a doctoral thesis (or vice versa). If the model doesn&apos;t know the setting or audience, it can&apos;t strike the right tone &#x2014; whether that&apos;s conversational and friendly, or professional and reserved.  </li>
<li><strong>Excessive or unexplained jargon:</strong> With no defined audience, the AI might include acronyms and technical terms without explanation, which will confuse many readers. Or it might swing to the opposite extreme and avoid any technical language, over-explaining basic concepts and boring readers who are already knowledgeable. In other words, the balance between jargon and explanation will be off.  </li>
<li><strong>Generic style:</strong> Lacking a target audience, the content often ends up generic and colorless. It won&apos;t include the kind of examples, analogies, or context that make writing resonate with a particular group. It&apos;s essentially a one-size-fits-all message &#x2014; and one-size-fits-all usually means that no one is truly satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these issues boil down to the fact that if the AI aims for &quot;everyone,&quot; the response isn&apos;t especially useful for <em>anyone</em>. When the AI doesn&apos;t have an audience target, it produces content for a generic reader. And as the saying goes, trying to please everyone often pleases no one.</p>
<p>This audience problem is distinct from the <strong>Persona</strong> pattern, even though both involve giving the AI context. Recall that the Persona pattern is about defining <em>who the AI should be</em> &#x2014; for example, telling it to respond as a historian or a friendly librarian. The Audience pattern, by contrast, is about defining <em>who the AI is addressing</em>. These two patterns complement each other. Even if you&apos;ve told the model to adopt a persona, you should still specify the audience to get the best results. For instance, if you prompt, &quot;You are a professor of history,&quot; but don&apos;t say who the explanation is for, that professor persona might default to lecture mode for an academic audience. That could be fine if you&apos;re writing for a journal, but it will backfire if your actual audience is a group of eighth-graders. Conversely, you might have an AI persona that&apos;s perfect for generating detailed technical explanations, but if you don&apos;t mention that the audience is, say, a team of expert engineers, the AI might hold back on using technical terminology or omit deeper analysis. In short, persona sets the voice and perspective, but audience targeting sets the <strong>level and style</strong> of the communication.</p>
<p>Often, users only realize the audience was unclear after they see a mismatched answer. They then have to do a follow-up prompt to fix it &#x2013; something like, &quot;Actually, explain that again in simple terms for a general reader,&quot; or &quot;Please rewrite this with more technical detail for experts.&quot; The AI will adjust its response accordingly, and the second try will likely be much closer to what they needed. But that back-and-forth means the first attempt didn&apos;t save much time after all. It&apos;s a bit like having to rewrite the draft yourself, except in two steps. The Audience pattern is about avoiding that wasted step. By telling the AI who the audience is from the outset, you can get a useful answer on the first go.</p>
<p>The frustration of having to rewrite or heavily edit an AI-generated draft to suit your audience is exactly what motivates the Audience pattern. It&apos;s far more efficient to guide the AI upfront than to fix the output after the fact. By clearly stating your intended audience in the prompt, you align the response with your needs from the outset. Instead of getting a one-size-fits-all draft and then tailoring it yourself, you can have the AI do that tailoring for you. You won&#x2019;t have to worry whether the answer will be too dense or too simplistic &#x2013; you&apos;ll have steered it to the right level. Ultimately, defining the audience ensures the LLM&apos;s output is tuned to the people who will actually read it, saving you time and resulting in communication that hits home on the first try.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let&apos;s return to our community health worker from the earlier scenario. After recognizing the issue, she decides to apply the <strong>Audience</strong> pattern on her next try. Instead of letting the LLM guess who the readers are, she makes it explicit in her prompt. This time she writes something like:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Write a short article on how the flu vaccine works and why it&apos;s important <strong>for a general community newsletter audience with no medical background</strong>. Use a clear, friendly tone that non-experts will understand and relate to.&quot;</em></p>
<p>By clearly stating that the article is for a general community newsletter and emphasizing a friendly, non-expert tone, she&apos;s giving the AI crucial direction. She&apos;s essentially saying: <em>&quot;Write as if you&apos;re explaining it to everyday folks in my town.&quot;</em> </p>
<p>So, what difference does this make? Let&#x2019;s compare the kind of output she gets now with the earlier attempt.</p>
<p>Without any audience specified, the opening of the LLM&#x2019;s article was something like:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Influenza vaccines (flu shots) contain antigens that stimulate an immune response, causing the body to produce antibodies against the influenza virus. This immune response helps prevent infection or reduce the severity of illness. Getting vaccinated is important because it reduces the overall rates of influenza-related illness, hospitalization, and death, especially in vulnerable populations.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#x2019;t incorrect, but it was dry and full of terms an average reader might not grasp or find engaging. It sounded like a snippet from a public health report or textbook.</p>
<p>Now, with the audience clearly defined, the response might start off on a much more accessible note:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Ever wonder how a simple flu shot keeps you healthy all winter? The flu vaccine is like a training exercise for your immune system &#x2013; it teaches your body to recognize and fight off the flu virus. By getting the vaccine, you not only protect yourself from getting really sick, but you also help protect your family and neighbors. When lots of people get their flu shots, the whole community stays healthier.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately, you can see the output has transformed in style and clarity:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simpler language:</strong> In the audience-tailored version, there&#x2019;s no mention of &#x201C;antigens&#x201D; or &#x201C;morbidity rates.&#x201D; Instead, it uses everyday words and phrases like &#x201C;keeps you healthy all winter.&#x201D; This ensures that readers without medical knowledge can easily follow along.  </li>
<li><strong>Engaging tone:</strong> The improved output starts with a question &#x2014; <em>&quot;Ever wonder...?&quot;</em> &#x2014; which draws the reader in. It feels conversational, almost like the writer is speaking to the reader directly. The tone is warm and encouraging, fitting for a community newsletter, unlike the impersonal tone of the first version.  </li>
<li><strong>Relatable examples and analogies:</strong> The vaccine is described as &quot;a training exercise for your immune system,&quot; an analogy a broad audience can visualize. It also mentions protecting &#x201C;your family and neighbors,&#x201D; which makes the message personal and community-oriented. The original version stayed abstract and clinical, whereas this one creates a connection with the reader&#x2019;s everyday life.  </li>
<li><strong>Appropriate detail:</strong> The revised answer focuses on key points that matter to the general public (staying healthy, protecting the community) without diving into unnecessary technical detail. The first version, by contrast, emphasized the biological mechanism in a way that might be excessive for lay readers.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to these changes, our health worker now has a draft that she can use almost immediately. It conveys the importance of flu vaccines in a friendly, understandable way. Instead of a dense write-up she&apos;d have to rewrite, she has a community-friendly article ready to go. All she did was add one sentence to her prompt specifying the audience, and the quality of the output improved dramatically.</p>
<p>This pattern of specifying the audience isn&#x2019;t just useful for health explainers &#x2013; it works in virtually any field. Here are a couple more examples to show its versatility:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Legal writing:</strong> Imagine a lawyer using an LLM to draft a summary of a new law. If she simply prompts, &quot;Summarize the XYZ Act,&quot; she might get a summary full of legal jargon and dense sentences &#x2013; fine for another lawyer, perhaps, but not for a client who isn&apos;t versed in legal terms. However, if she prompts, &quot;Summarize the XYZ Act <strong>for a small business owner with no legal background</strong>, in plain language,&quot; the tone and content will shift. The LLM might produce a clearer explanation like, <em>&quot;The XYZ Act is a new law that requires businesses to...,&quot;</em> breaking down the provisions into everyday terms and focusing on practical implications. The client-friendly version might say, <em>&quot;In short, if you run a small business, this law means you need to do X, Y, Z to stay compliant,&quot;</em> instead of dumping a wall of statutory text. By defining the audience (a small business owner), the lawyer gets a summary she can directly send to her client, confident that it won&apos;t confuse or overwhelm them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Community outreach:</strong> Consider a non-profit volunteer writing a public announcement about a new recycling program. A generic prompt like &quot;Write an announcement about our new recycling initiative&quot; might yield a formal, boilerplate notice: <em>&quot;The organization is implementing a recycling initiative to improve sustainability...&quot;</em> &#x2013; technically fine, but a bit stiff and not very inspiring. If the volunteer instead specifies, &quot;Write an announcement about our new recycling initiative <strong>for local residents in an upbeat, approachable tone</strong>,&quot; the result could be much more engaging. The AI might respond with something like, <em>&quot;Good news! Our neighborhood is kicking off a new recycling program, and we need your help to make it a success. Here&apos;s how it works...&quot;</em> and use friendly language throughout. The audience-defined version might include details that resonate with residents (like mentioning community pride or cleaner parks), whereas the generic version would stick to impersonal generalities. In this way, a simple tweak &#x2013; mentioning that the audience is &quot;local residents&quot; and setting an upbeat tone &#x2013; yields a message that people are more likely to read and act on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few tips when applying the Audience pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify the audience clearly:</strong> Mention who the readers are (e.g., &quot;a general reader,&quot; &quot;high school students,&quot; &quot;experts in finance&quot;). The more specific, the better the model can tailor the response.  </li>
<li><strong>Specify their knowledge level:</strong> If relevant, state what they likely know or don&#x2019;t know. For example, tell the AI &quot;assume the reader has no prior knowledge of this topic&quot; or &quot;the audience is familiar with basic concepts but not the jargon.&quot;  </li>
<li><strong>Mention the context or format:</strong> If the setting is important, include it. Writing &quot;for a community newsletter&quot; or &quot;for an internal company memo&quot; helps the AI adopt an appropriate style and length.  </li>
<li><strong>Set the tone through the audience:</strong> If your audience expects a certain tone, let the AI know. You can say something like &quot;explain in a fun, simple way (audience: elementary school kids)&quot; or &quot;use a professional tone (audience: corporate board members).&quot; The audience description itself often implies the right tone.  </li>
<li><strong>Combine with Persona (if needed):</strong> Using Audience doesn&apos;t conflict with the Persona pattern &#x2013; you can do both. Giving the AI a role (persona) and an audience can yield an even more targeted response, as in &quot;As a financial advisor, explain to a client...&quot; This ensures it has the expertise (persona) and pitches it correctly (audience).</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, you could prompt: <em>&quot;You are a veteran software engineer. Explain the concept of blockchain <strong>to a group of college students studying economics</strong>.&quot;</em> Here you&apos;ve given the AI both a persona (an experienced engineer) and an audience (economics students with presumably limited tech background). The persona provides expertise and credibility, and the specified audience ensures the explanation will connect with those particular students. The resulting answer would likely be rich in insight yet still accessible.</p>
<p>No matter the domain, the takeaway is clear: when you define who the content is for, you empower the AI to produce more targeted, effective responses. Instead of guessing, the model can tailor its output in one go. For anyone who has ever had to rephrase or redo an AI-generated text because it wasn&apos;t quite right for the intended readers, the Audience pattern offers a straightforward remedy. It&apos;s about setting the stage so that the first draft is already in the right ballpark, needing only minor tweaks instead of a major overhaul.</p>
<p>In summary, always take a moment to consider your audience when writing a prompt. It&apos;s a simple addition &#x2013; a phrase or a sentence in your instructions &#x2013; but it often separates a mediocre result from an excellent one. By doing so, you&apos;ll get answers that don&apos;t just answer the question, but do so in a way that truly speaks to your audience.</p>
