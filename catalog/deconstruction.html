<p><em>Use the LLM to deconstruct examples and reveal their structure and style.</em></p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Many of us attempt to learn new skills by studying good examples. However, it can be challenging to replicate a great piece of writing or technique just by observation. The LLM might imitate surface features of an example without truly understanding the underlying structure or method. If the example isn&#x2019;t thoroughly analyzed by either you or the model, important patterns or reasoning steps may remain hidden. This can lead to weaker results when you attempt something similar. In short, simply admiring a well-crafted example isn&#x2019;t enough to reproduce its success &#x2013; you need to understand <em>why</em> it works.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Have the LLM analyze and break down an example step by step. In your prompt, ask the model to explain how a given piece of writing or solution is constructed (for instance, <em>&#x201C;Explain the structure and approach used in the above example.&#x201D;</em>). By getting the LLM to reverse-engineer the example, it will make implicit elements explicit &#x2014; identifying the methodology, structure, and style used. This understanding can then guide the LLM (and you) in creating new content that follows the same successful pattern, now that you know the &#x201C;recipe&#x201D; behind the example.</p>
<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
<p>Why is learning from examples so difficult? A great piece of writing can feel like a <em>monolith</em> &#x2013; a single, seamless whole that&#x2019;s impressive but opaque. You see the polished result, but not the process or components that went into it. For a human writer, reading an excellent report or article might inspire awe, yet it&#x2019;s hard to pinpoint <em>what exactly</em> makes it so good. For an LLM user, providing a model with a top-notch example and saying &#x201C;do it like this&#x201D; often isn&#x2019;t sufficient. Without further guidance, the model might latch onto shallow cues (a particular phrasing or fancy word) rather than the deeper structure or strategy that truly deserves emulation. The challenge lies in moving beyond surface imitation to true understanding of an example&#x2019;s inner workings.</p>
<p>At first glance, copying a style or format seems straightforward. We&#x2019;ve all tried to emulate examples in our own work &#x2013; a student mimicking the style of a well-written essay, or a professional referencing a sample report to draft their own. But if you&#x2019;ve ever done this, you know it&#x2019;s easier said than done. A novice might borrow a few impressive phrases or adopt a similar tone, only to find that their result doesn&#x2019;t have the same impact as the original. The reason is simple: the <em>essence</em> of the example was not captured. Great writing often involves multiple layers (structure, tone, choice of arguments, flow of ideas) all working together. If you only copy the outer layer (say, the vocabulary) without the inner logic (how the argument is built or how the information is organized), the outcome feels like a cheap imitation.</p>
<p>To truly learn from an example, one must discern the hidden elements that aren&#x2019;t immediately obvious. This is inherently difficult. When you read a powerful speech or a compelling article, the author&#x2019;s techniques are woven invisibly into the fabric of the text. You typically don&#x2019;t notice &#x201C;Ah, here is the thesis statement, here&#x2019;s a metaphor to reinforce the point, here&#x2019;s a strategic use of a question to engage me.&#x201D; As readers, we experience the piece holistically, not as separate parts. The writing is doing its job so well that its craftsmanship becomes invisible. This is wonderful for enjoying the text, but troublesome when you want to learn how to create a similar effect. The challenge for an LLM user (or any learner) is that the example doesn&#x2019;t come with an instruction manual. We have the finished cake, but not the recipe.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s where the concept of <strong>deconstruction</strong> comes in. The term &#x201C;deconstruction&#x201D; was famously used by philosopher Jacques Derrida to describe a method of critically analyzing texts. In academic circles, deconstruction can get very abstract &#x2013; it&#x2019;s about questioning assumptions and taking apart meanings within a text. But at its core, you can think of it in simpler terms: to deconstruct is to take something apart into its components. Derrida&#x2019;s idea, in a broad sense, encourages us to break down a &#x201C;monolith&#x201D; (be it a concept or a piece of writing) to understand the interplay of its parts. In our context, we&#x2019;re borrowing this fancy-sounding word to mean <em>breaking a whole piece into pieces to see what it&#x2019;s made of</em>. If a well-written report is a monolithic stone statue, deconstruction is like taking a careful look at that statue&#x2019;s features, chisel marks, and separate shapes, so we can figure out how it was crafted.</p>
<p>Think of a great piece of writing as a beautifully constructed building. From the outside, it&#x2019;s impressive and complete &#x2013; a monolith of excellence. But if you&#x2019;re an architect who wants to learn from it, you&#x2019;d love to get a peek at the blueprints or examine the construction materials. Without that, you&#x2019;re left guessing: <em>Is it the foundation that makes it stand strong, or the design of the arches, or the choice of materials?</em> Similarly, when reading someone else&#x2019;s document that turned out brilliantly, you might wonder: <em>Is it the tone that makes it so effective, the way arguments are structured, or perhaps the vivid examples used?</em> Often it&#x2019;s not one thing but a combination, carefully balanced. Yet none of this is obvious just by looking at the final product.</p>
<p>Another metaphor: consider tasting a delicious soup made by a master chef. You know it&#x2019;s delicious, but why? If you had the recipe, you could list the ingredients and steps. Without it, you might only guess: <em>I taste basil&#x2026; maybe there&#x2019;s a hint of lemon?</em> You might try to recreate it by adding those apparent flavors, but miss subtler ones like a dash of cinnamon or the technique of slow simmering that blended the flavors. The result will fall short. A piece of writing works the same way. You &#x201C;taste&#x201D; the final flavor, but the ingredients (choice of words, tone, structure of arguments, pacing) and techniques (like using a question to introduce a problem, or a story to illustrate a point) are not immediately obvious. Learning from examples requires uncovering those hidden ingredients and techniques.</p>
<p>For a non-technical professional &#x2013; say, a civil servant who finds an excellent policy brief written by a colleague &#x2013; the situation is familiar. The brief is clear, persuasive, and well-received. Our civil servant wants to write like that. If he simply copies the colleague&#x2019;s wording here and there, or tries to mirror the formal tone, his next draft might improve slightly, but it likely won&#x2019;t measure up. Why? Because the effectiveness of the original brief might lie in its structure (perhaps it opened with a compelling summary, then presented evidence in a logical sequence, then addressed potential concerns) as well as its tone (maybe confident yet empathetic) and phrasing (jargon-free but authoritative). These qualities aren&#x2019;t obvious without analysis. The challenge is that <em>good writing doesn&#x2019;t wear its &#x201C;recipe&#x201D; on its sleeve</em>. You have to dig for it.</p>
<p>When using LLMs, the problem is mirrored. If you give an AI model an example and say &#x201C;write something like this,&#x201D; the model will try its best to comply &#x2013; but what does it mean by &#x201C;like this&#x201D;? Without further instruction, &#x201C;like this&#x201D; could mislead the model into copying superficial traits. It might pepper the new content with similar adjectives or mimic the polite greeting and closing from your example (if it was a letter), yet miss the fact that, structurally, the example devoted the first half to framing the problem and the second half to proposing solutions. The model doesn&#x2019;t automatically infer all those deeper patterns from one example unless asked to analyze them. It might produce output that <em>looks</em> somewhat similar but doesn&#x2019;t achieve the same effect, leaving the user puzzled why the magic didn&#x2019;t happen.</p>
<p>In essence, the big challenge is <strong>making the implicit explicit</strong>. An example carries implicit knowledge: unwritten rules, patterns, and decisions that made it work. As long as those remain implicit, neither you nor the LLM can fully leverage them. What we need is a way to break open the monolith and extract the valuable pieces inside. This is counterintuitive because we&#x2019;re used to treating examples as wholes &#x2013; we admire or critique the overall product. But to learn from it, we must switch to analysis mode. Traditionally, a skilled writing coach or a critical reader can do this: they might annotate an essay, pointing out &#x201C;Notice how this paragraph introduces a problem, and the next gives context, and only then do they propose a solution &#x2013; that sequencing is a technique.&#x201D; When you don&#x2019;t have a human coach at hand, you can turn to the LLM as your analytical assistant.</p>
<p>A final aspect of the challenge is psychological: without deconstruction, we often either <em>over-credit</em> or <em>under-credit</em> the example. Over-crediting means we assume the example is just genius as a whole and we feel we could never replicate it &#x2013; leading to discouragement rather than learning. Under-crediting or mis-crediting means we latch onto one feature and think &#x201C;if I use fancy vocabulary like in this article, my writing will be great too,&#x201D; overlooking that the article&#x2019;s greatness had more to do with its clear structure or persuasive logic than its vocabulary. In both cases, we fail to learn effectively because we didn&#x2019;t break the example down properly. By explicitly analyzing an example&#x2019;s components, we avoid those missteps. We neither idolize the example as untouchable magic, nor blindly copy elements out of context. Instead, we understand it piece by piece, which is empowering. Once you see how the parts fit together, you feel <em>&#x201C;I can do this too, now that I know what the parts are.&#x201D;</em></p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>How can we apply deconstruction in practice? Let&#x2019;s walk through a real scenario. The author of this book (Pattern Language of LLM Prompting) faced exactly the challenge described above. I greatly admired the writing style of Martin Fowler&#x2019;s book <em>Refactoring</em>, a classic in software engineering. Fowler&#x2019;s book is engaging, clear, and instructive in a way I hoped to emulate for my own writing. However, simply knowing that I liked Fowler&#x2019;s style wasn&#x2019;t enough &#x2013; I needed to pinpoint <em>what</em> elements of his writing made it so effective. In other words, I needed to deconstruct Fowler&#x2019;s style into a usable guide.</p>
<p>To do this, I turned to the LLM as an analytical partner. I provided the LLM with portions of Fowler&#x2019;s text and explicitly asked it to break down the writing style and structure. In one instance, for example, I took a chapter introduction and prompted the model with something along these lines: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> &#x201C;Here is an excerpt from Martin Fowler&#x2019;s <em>Refactoring</em>. Analyze the writing style and explain its key characteristics. Consider aspects like tone, choice of words, sentence structure, and how the content is organized.&#x201D;<br><strong>LLM Analysis (excerpt):</strong> &#x201C;The tone of the writing is pragmatic and action-oriented, yet conversational. Fowler often speaks from personal experience (e.g., saying he&#x2019;s seen certain problems many times) which gives an authoritative but approachable voice. The vocabulary is clear and direct, with occasional use of metaphor (for instance, referring to code issues as &#x2018;bad smells&#x2019; to make the idea memorable). Sentences vary in length: some are short and emphatic, while others are longer with embedded clauses to explain reasoning. The author frequently uses imperative mood (e.g., &#x2018;Create a class&#x2026;&#x2019; or &#x2018;Replace the code&#x2026;&#x2019;) to give instructions. The passage is structured in a logical flow &#x2013; it introduces a scenario, explains the problem, then presents the solution concept. Overall, the style balances instructional clarity with engaging anecdotes.&#x201D;  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(The above is a synthesized illustration of the kind of analysis an LLM can provide.)</em></p>
<p>This kind of prompt-and-analysis approach is the heart of the <strong>Deconstruction</strong> pattern. By asking the LLM to enumerate the characteristics of Fowler&#x2019;s writing, I obtained an explicit list of style elements that I could study and reuse. In fact, I iterated on the process, probing deeper with the LLM. I asked follow-up questions to get more detail: &#x201C;Can you break down the tone more? What makes it pragmatic and not just academic?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Describe the structural elements Fowler uses in organizing his chapters.&#x201D; The AI&#x2019;s responses became a comprehensive style guide for Fowler&#x2019;s approach.</p>
<p>After a thorough deconstruction, I ended up with a clear picture of Fowler&#x2019;s style distilled into a few key dimensions. In particular, the analysis revealed four major stylistic pillars that define how <em>Refactoring</em> is written. They were:  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tone</strong> &#x2013; The attitude and voice of the writing. Fowler&#x2019;s tone is pragmatic and action-oriented, as if he&#x2019;s giving professional advice that you can apply immediately. It&#x2019;s confident (born of experience) but also friendly and not condescending. Importantly, it&#x2019;s instructional in nature: the text often speaks directly to the reader with guidance. There&#x2019;s also a conversational element at times &#x2013; he uses personal anecdotes and even humor or questions to engage the reader, which prevents the writing from feeling too dry or didactic.  </li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary &amp; Phrasing</strong> &#x2013; The choice of words and the way sentences are phrased. Fowler uses clear and straightforward language that a broad audience of programmers can understand. He doesn&#x2019;t bog the reader down with unnecessary jargon; when he uses technical terms, it&#x2019;s because they matter, and he usually explains them. At the same time, the writing is rich with metaphors and analogies (&#x201C;code smells,&#x201D; &#x201C;wearing two hats,&#x201D; etc.) which serve to make abstract or complex ideas more concrete and memorable. The phrasing tends to emphasize key principles (sometimes literally stating a rule or tip). He also favors active voice (&#x201C;Do X&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;X should be done&#x201D;), which makes instructions crystal clear.  </li>
<li><strong>Sentence Structure &amp; Flow</strong> &#x2013; How sentences are constructed and how one flows to the next. The text in <em>Refactoring</em> varies sentence length to keep a good pace &#x2013; a punchy short sentence might drive a point home after a series of longer explanatory sentences. Fowler also uses structured lists and bullet points when explaining a process step-by-step, which helps break down complex processes (for example, when detailing the mechanics of a refactoring, he&#x2019;ll list steps 1, 2, 3&#x2026;). There&#x2019;s a logical progression in the narrative: strong topic sentences introduce what a section or paragraph is about, and transitions are clear, so the reader is never lost. Sometimes rhetorical questions appear, e.g., &#x201C;So why would we ever refactor?,&#x201D; immediately followed by an answer. This technique engages the reader in a sort of dialogue, addressing doubts or curiosities at just the right moment.  </li>
<li><strong>Structural Elements</strong> &#x2013; Higher-level organization and format of the content. Fowler&#x2019;s book has a consistent structure for each refactoring pattern, almost like a template: each chapter (pattern) starts with a motivating example or scenario, then the solution (the refactoring technique) is explained, followed by details on how to apply it (mechanics) and an example. This repetition of structure across chapters makes the book easy to navigate and use as a reference &#x2013; you know where to find the motivation, the detailed steps, etc., in each case. The language reflects this structure by often explicitly labeling sections (&#x201C;Motivation,&#x201D; &#x201C;Example,&#x201D; etc.) and by maintaining a cohesive flow within that template. Additionally, Fowler integrates different voices and contributions (like having a foreword by someone else, or sidebars by colleagues), yet the overall style remains unified in its pragmatic, get-to-the-point approach. He even explains in the text why he presents things a certain way (for instance, he might justify why examples come first &#x2013; to grab attention &#x2013; rather than theory). This transparency in structure is a subtle stylistic choice too, making the reader feel taken into confidence about how to use the book.  </li>
</ol>
<p>By breaking down Fowler&#x2019;s writing into those four dimensions, I essentially obtained a <em>blueprint</em> for his style. This deconstruction was incredibly useful. Once I had this &#x201C;style guide&#x201D; in hand, I could apply it to my own writing process. In fact, I took the extra step of incorporating these findings directly into my prompt when using the LLM to help write this book. Using the <strong>Chapter</strong> pattern (discussed earlier in the book), I created a special chapter in my prompt that summarized Fowler&#x2019;s style &#x2013; essentially feeding the LLM the list of characteristics above as guidance. Then, whenever I asked the LLM to generate text for the book, I included instructions to follow that style guide. This is a powerful combination of patterns: <strong>Deconstruction</strong> gave me the insights, and <strong>Style Mimicry</strong> (along with a structured prompt) allowed the LLM to imitate the Fowler-like style in new content. The result is that the chapters of <em>Pattern Language of LLM Prompting</em> (including this one) are written in a style inspired by a proven, effective author, rather than in a generic or inconsistent voice.</p>
<p>More generally, you can use this approach with any example that you find exemplary and want to learn from. The process can be summarized in a few practical steps: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Select a strong example</strong> of the kind of output you want. It could be a well-written letter, a great lesson plan, a clear policy brief, a high-quality essay &#x2013; anything relevant to your needs.  </li>
<li><strong>Feed it to the LLM with a request to analyze it.</strong> Be specific in your prompt about what you want to know. For instance: <em>&#x201C;Explain the structure and style of the above document. What is the tone, and how is the argument structured? What writing techniques make it effective?&#x201D;</em> The more detail you ask for, the more thorough the breakdown will be. You can even instruct the LLM to organize its analysis into categories (tone, wording, structure, etc.) as I did.  </li>
<li><strong>Review and refine the analysis.</strong> The LLM will present you with its take on the example. Read through it and see if it makes sense and if it uncovered insights you hadn&#x2019;t noticed. You might need to ask follow-up questions. Maybe the initial analysis says &#x201C;The letter uses a formal tone and emotional appeal.&#x201D; You could follow up: <em>&#x201C;What makes the tone formal? Can you give examples? How is the emotional appeal conveyed?&#x201D;</em> This iterative probing ensures you get a deep and accurate deconstruction.  </li>
<li><strong>Extract key principles or guidelines.</strong> From the LLM&#x2019;s breakdown, distill the key elements that you want to apply. This might become a checklist or a mini style guide for you. In the case of the policy brief example, you might end up with notes like: &#x201C;Tone: respectful and formal, avoids slang; Structure: starts with an executive summary, uses bullet points for recommendations; Phrasing: uses specific statistics to support points, lots of transitional phrases like &#x2018;however,&#x2019; &#x2018;moreover&#x2019; to guide the reader,&#x201D; and so on.  </li>
<li><strong>Apply those principles to new work with the LLM&#x2019;s help.</strong> Now when you or the LLM draft a new document in this genre, consciously use the extracted elements. You can literally tell the LLM, <em>&#x201C;Write a first draft of XYZ. Use a respectful, formal tone. Begin with a summary, and include bullet-point recommendations. Incorporate relevant statistics and use clear transitions as seen in the example style.&#x201D;</em> By feeding back the deconstructed insights, you guide the model to produce something that has the bones of the great example, not just the skin. </li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout this process, the LLM is both your microscope and your apprentice. First it acts as the microscope, helping you zoom in on the example and see the fibers of its fabric. Then it becomes the apprentice that learns from that examination &#x2013; taking the extracted pattern and attempting to weave a new piece in the same style. The human user remains the master craftsperson in the loop: you choose the example, you steer the analysis, and you decide which insights to apply. The LLM accelerates those steps, doing the heavy lifting of textual analysis and later, initial drafting under your guidance.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s worth noting that deconstruction isn&#x2019;t only about mimicking others&#x2019; styles &#x2013; it also builds your own understanding. You&#x2019;ll find that after deconstructing a few examples with an LLM, you start to naturally notice patterns in writing more. It trains <em>your</em> eye. In the Fowler example, working with the LLM&#x2019;s analysis taught me as much about writing style as it taught the model. I became more conscious of things like varying sentence length for effect or the power of a well-placed metaphor. This made me a better writer and editor, which is an added benefit beyond the immediate use with the AI.</p>
<p>In summary, <strong>Deconstruction</strong> is a pattern that addresses a fundamental hurdle in learning from examples. By using the LLM to break a model example into its constituent parts, you obtain a clear map of what makes that example successful. With that map in hand, you and the LLM can navigate in the footsteps of the example without simply copying it. Instead of gazing up at a monolithic masterpiece and feeling incapable of reproducing it, you&#x2019;re taking it apart like a curious engineer or critic, understanding how it works, and then building your own masterpiece piece by piece with confidence.</p>
