### Epistemology Frame  
Provide a guiding ideology or worldview to shape the LLM's thinking.

**Challenge:** Without a guiding philosophy or perspective, the LLM will respond with a neutral standpoint that might not align with the intended angle of analysis. Tasks that require a specific ideological or methodological viewpoint may suffer because the model isn't inherently biased toward that approach. This can result in output that lacks the depth or flavor of the desired perspective.

**Solution:** State the philosophical, ideological, or methodological framework that the LLM should adopt for the task. For example, you can instruct the model to approach the problem from a Marxist perspective, a libertarian viewpoint, a religious outlook, or to apply a particular methodology (like the scientific method). By providing such a frame, you implicitly shape how the LLM reasons through the task, aligning its thought process and tone with that viewpoint. This technique can deeply influence the nature of the answer, ensuring the output stays consistent with the chosen perspective.
