# Exhaustive Input

*Provide as much information as possible; more context yields better results.*

## Motivation

If a prompt only includes minimal information, the LLM might not have enough context to produce a good answer. Important details or background could be missing, forcing the model to fill gaps with assumptions or general knowledge. This often leads to inaccuracies or overly generic responses – especially on specialized topics where every detail matters. The user’s request can be misunderstood or too vaguely interpreted simply because the AI wasn’t given the necessary facts up front.

## Solution

Give the LLM as much relevant information as you can when writing your prompt. Include all necessary background, data, and specifics so that little is left to assumption. The larger the knowledge base you provide, the better the LLM can understand your request and perform the task. In practice, this might mean providing lengthy descriptions, data excerpts, or multiple pieces of context — essentially, err on the side of **too much information** rather than too little (as long as it’s relevant). By front-loading comprehensive context, you guide the model toward more accurate and tailored outputs.

## Challenge

**Why Incomplete Input is a Problem:** One of the most common mistakes users make with LLMs is not providing enough information in their query. It’s easy to assume that the AI “knows what I mean” or can fill in the blanks, but in reality the model is not a mind reader. If your input is sparse or missing key details, the AI has no choice but to guess or rely on generic knowledge. The result? Often an output that misses the mark. Let’s explore the kinds of problems that arise when you don’t give an LLM all the context it needs:

- **Ambiguity and Misinterpretation:** With too little information, your prompt might be ambiguous. For example, if you ask, *“Draft a plan for improving education”* without specifying the region, level, or any specifics, the AI won’t know whether you mean elementary education in a rural county, higher education in a city, or something else entirely. Lacking clear direction, it might choose a random interpretation (possibly not the one you intended) and give an answer that doesn’t fit your actual needs. Ambiguous queries force the model to make assumptions, and those assumptions can easily be wrong.

- **Generic or Shallow Responses:** Incomplete input often yields very generic outputs. If you provide only a brief question or a one-liner task description, the AI will respond with broadly applicable, boilerplate information. For instance, a user asks, *“How do I improve digital services?”* and gives no further context. The LLM might respond with a list of obvious best practices that read like a common article on the internet — technically reasonable advice, but nothing specific to the user’s situation. It may say, *“Increase broadband access, provide training workshops, ensure accessibility,”* etc., which are valid but superficial. The answer lacks depth because the prompt didn’t supply any details that the model could latch onto for a deeper analysis. Essentially, you get an answer that could apply to almost anyone, anywhere, because you didn’t tell the AI what makes **your** case unique.

- **Incorrect Assumptions and “Hallucinations”:** When details are missing, the model might fill gaps with its own assumptions, which can lead to factual errors. Large language models have a vast store of general knowledge, and if your question is open-ended, they might pull in facts that sound plausible but aren’t actually true for your context. This is often called a *hallucination* – the AI isn’t intentionally lying; it’s generating a detail that fits the pattern of a good answer, except that detail wasn’t provided by you and might be wrong. For example, if you ask for an analysis of a company without giving the latest data, the AI might **invent** some numbers or refer to trends that apply to a generic company rather than the specific one you have in mind. In a way, the model is like a student who didn’t get the textbook for a class – it will try to bluff its way through the answer with whatever general knowledge it has, and that can be risky.

- **Lack of Specificity for Specialized Tasks:** Domain-specific or highly technical tasks particularly suffer from incomplete input. Imagine asking an AI to *“evaluate the patient’s test results and suggest a treatment plan.”* If you don’t actually provide the patient’s test results, the AI can only speak in generalities about what such tests might show or what treatment *could* be suggested. It might produce a generic medical overview that isn’t useful for the actual patient in question. The same goes for other fields: asking for legal advice without showing the relevant law or contract, or requesting a software code review without providing the code, will lead to answers that are generic or abstract. The AI has knowledge of *typical* cases, but without your case’s details, it can’t give a tailored answer. In the worst case, it might assume details incorrectly. For instance, asking *“How do I fix this error?”* without including the error message or code could prompt the model to guess a cause and solution – which might not at all apply to your situation.

- **Confusion in Creative Projects:** In creative tasks like writing stories, scripts, or proposals, missing context can derail the output. If you ask an AI to write the next chapter of your novel but don’t provide the previous chapters or a summary of them, the AI has to invent context. The characters might behave inconsistently or new plot points might appear that don’t align with your story. The result can feel disconnected from what you actually had in mind. The AI isn’t continuing **your** story; it’s effectively starting a new story that simply fits the prompt it was given. Likewise, if you request a marketing brochure for your product but only say, “It’s a tech gadget,” the output will be extremely general and fail to highlight the specific value or features of your actual product, because the model wasn’t told what those were.

All these issues stem from one root cause: not giving the model enough to work with. A large language model operates under the principle **“garbage in, garbage out.”** If you feed it a bare-bones prompt, you’re likely to get a bare-bones answer. The model doesn’t have an innate ability to know *which details about your situation are important* unless you explicitly provide them. It has tons of knowledge in its parameters, yes, but it doesn’t know which pieces of that knowledge are relevant to you right now. Unlike a human, it won’t always ask for clarification or more info – it will do its best with whatever you gave it, even if that’s just a single sentence. Think of it this way: using an LLM with scant input is like hiring a consultant but only giving them a one-paragraph brief about a complex problem. You shouldn’t be surprised if their advice comes back generic or misses the mark entirely; you simply didn’t set them up for success.

**Understanding the AI’s “Memory”:** It’s important to realize that mainstream LLMs do **not** have long-term memory of past conversations or any information you haven’t provided in the current session. When you use a chatbot or prompt an LLM, the model isn’t actually recalling memories in the way humans do. Instead, it works from the text that is in its **context window** – essentially, the conversation or prompt history that you supply each time. If something isn’t in that context window, the model has no awareness of it. This means if you start a new chat session or send a fresh prompt, it won’t remember anything you discussed previously. Every time you interact, you must include the relevant details anew. For example, suppose on Monday you told the AI a bunch of facts about your project. If you come back on Tuesday and ask it a question *without restating those facts or continuing the same chat thread*, the AI will not remember Monday’s information. From the AI’s perspective, Tuesday’s query is a blank slate aside from what you type in at that moment.

Even within a single ongoing conversation, the model’s “memory” is just the accumulation of the conversation so far that is kept within the context window. Many chat interfaces do this behind the scenes: when you ask a follow-up question, the system actually resends the previous dialogue along with your new question to provide context. The takeaway for users is that **the AI only “sees” what you provide each time**. There is no hidden knowledge base of your specific documents or personal context unless you explicitly include it. This is why providing exhaustive input is so crucial – it’s literally the only way the model can know those details.

**Context Window – Use It or Lose It:** Luckily, modern LLMs have been rapidly expanding how much information they can handle in one go. The term “context window” refers to the amount of text (in tokens, where 1 token is roughly ¾ of a word) the model can consider at once. Early versions of these models might only take a few thousand tokens, which limited how much background you could give. But as of 2025, state-of-the-art models support very large context windows. For instance, OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo model boasts a 128K token context window, meaning it can accept and process the equivalent of over 300 pages of text in a single prompt ([New models and developer products announced at DevDay | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday/#:~:text=GPT%E2%80%914%20Turbo%20is%20more%20capable,output%20tokens%20compared%20to%20GPT%E2%80%914)). Similarly, Anthropic’s Claude model was scaled up to handle about 100K tokens (~75,000 words of text, or hundreds of pages) ([Introducing 100K Context Windows \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/100k-context-windows#:~:text=We%E2%80%99ve%20expanded%20Claude%E2%80%99s%20context%20window,for%20hours%20or%20even%20days)). These advances imply that you, the user, can provide *extensive* documentation or context material alongside your request. In practical terms, you could literally feed a whole book or several lengthy reports into the model’s input if needed. This is a game-changer: instead of summarizing or omitting details because of past size limits, you can now opt to include **all** relevant information.

What does this mean for you? In short, you shouldn’t shy away from giving the AI a lot of input. If you have a 50-page policy draft and you need the AI to critique it, you can provide the entire text of the draft. If you have a detailed dataset or a long list of requirements, you can put them all into the prompt (or attach them, depending on the interface). The model can only use what it’s given, so taking advantage of the larger capacity leads to better-informed answers. You might worry, “Will the AI really read all that?” The answer is that it will process it as best as it can. With large context windows, designers of these models have also improved their ability to *utilize* long inputs effectively, though keep in mind extremely large inputs might still dilute focus or take longer to process. However, it’s generally far better to include too much detail than to leave out something important. If the detail turns out not to matter, no harm done – the AI can ignore extraneous info. But if it *does* matter and you omitted it, the AI has no way to recover that missing piece unless you notice the mistake and clarify later.

**Conversational Context vs. Attachments:** How you provide this exhaustive input can vary. In a conversational AI setting (like a chat), you might add information over a series of messages: for example, first share a background document in one message, then ask your question in the next. In other cases, you might literally attach a file or paste a long text as part of your prompt. Either way, it becomes part of the context that the model will analyze. Just remember that whether information comes in one message or several, it all counts toward that context window. Attaching a file with dozens of pages is effectively the same as copy-pasting those pages into your prompt from the model’s point of view.

One caution: when you do supply a lot of input – especially if it’s a mix of your own instructions and large blocks of reference text – be very clear in your prompt which is which. You don’t want the model to get confused about what you want it to do versus what is background info. For example, if you paste an entire policy document and then ask the model to critique it, make sure to say something like, “**Background document:** [text of policy] **Task:** Now critique the above policy.” This way, the model knows the difference between the content it should analyze and the instructions for the task. If you just dump text without labels, the AI might mistakenly treat part of that text as something it’s supposed to follow or respond to literally, rather than as informational context. (We delve more into strategies for handling multiple input sources and formatting them clearly in the **Attachment** pattern later in this book.) The key point for the **Exhaustive Input** pattern is: don’t hold back important information. Use the AI’s input capacity to your advantage, and craft your prompt so it’s crystal clear what context you’re providing and what you’re asking the model to do with it.

In summary, the challenge that **Exhaustive Input** addresses is the tendency to give the AI too little to work with, which leads to subpar results. The antidote is to feed it *everything relevant*. Modern LLMs are built to handle a deluge of information – indeed, they perform best when they can see the full picture. By overcoming the instinct to be brief and instead supplying exhaustive detail, you set the stage for the AI to generate a far more accurate, detailed, and context-aware response. Think of the model like a car engine: if you only trickle in a tiny bit of fuel (minimal input), it will sputter and stall; give it a full tank of gas (comprehensive input) and it can drive much farther. The next section will illustrate this difference with a real-world example, showing just how much stronger the AI’s output becomes when the prompt includes abundant context versus when it does not.

## Example

Imagine you are a civil servant working for the county government, and you’ve been tasked with drafting a policy proposal for **“Improving Digital Literacy in Lakeside County.”** This is an important project – the goal is to boost residents’ ability to use computers, the internet, and other digital tools, which in turn can help them access services, find jobs, and participate fully in the modern economy. You’ve gathered a lot of information about Lakeside County’s current situation: demographics, the state of internet infrastructure, existing programs, and so on. In fact, there’s a whole background report (let’s call it the *Lakeside County Digital Inclusion Assessment*) that details the community’s needs and resources. 

Now, you want to use an LLM to help draft the proposal. Let’s walk through two approaches to this task. In **Attempt 1**, we’ll see what happens when you provide only a brief prompt with very little of that background. In **Attempt 2**, we’ll see the result of using the **Exhaustive Input** pattern – giving the model all the relevant information from that report. The difference in the quality and specificity of the output will be clear.

### Attempt 1: Minimal Input (What Goes Wrong)

Suppose you decide to start with a simple prompt to get a first draft. You type into the AI chat or prompt box:

*“Write a policy proposal for improving digital literacy in Lakeside County.”*

That’s it – one sentence, no further context. Your thinking is that the model surely has general knowledge about digital literacy and can come up with some good ideas. After all, it’s read lots of articles and policies in its training, right? You hit enter and wait for the output. Here is an example of what you might get back from such a minimal prompt:

**Output (with minimal input):**

> **Title:** Lakeside County Digital Literacy Improvement Plan  
> **Introduction:**  
> Lakeside County recognizes the importance of digital literacy for all citizens. In today’s connected world, the ability to use computers and the internet is essential for education, employment, and everyday life. This proposal outlines a plan to improve digital literacy among residents of Lakeside County, ensuring everyone can participate in the digital age.  
>  
> **Background:**  
> Currently, many individuals in Lakeside County have limited access to digital tools and training. Some residents, especially in rural areas, face challenges in getting reliable internet access. Others may not have the necessary skills to use technology effectively. There is a need to bridge this digital divide and provide opportunities for all community members to enhance their digital skills.  
>  
> **Objectives:**  
> 1. Increase access to computers and high-speed internet for all residents.  
> 2. Provide training and workshops on digital skills for different age groups (students, working adults, seniors).  
> 3. Partner with local organizations to promote digital inclusion.  
>  
> **Proposed Actions:**  
> - **Expand Public Internet Access:** Set up free Wi-Fi hotspots in key locations such as libraries, community centers, and town halls. This will ensure people can get online even if they don’t have internet at home.  
> - **Digital Skills Workshops:** Organize regular workshops and classes. For example, libraries could host weekly sessions teaching basics like internet browsing, email use, online safety, and using office software. Schools can integrate more digital literacy into their curriculum for students.  
> - **Community Partnerships:** Work with nonprofits, educational institutions, and private sector partners (like tech companies or internet service providers) to support digital literacy programs. They might provide funding, equipment (such as donated computers), or instructors for training sessions.  
> - **Device Loan Program:** Consider establishing a device lending program where residents can borrow tablets or laptops from libraries or community centers, similar to checking out a book. This gives low-income residents a chance to practice and use digital tools at home.  
> - **Awareness Campaign:** Launch a public awareness campaign about the importance of digital skills. Use local media and social networks to inform people about the free resources and training available, encouraging them to take part.  
>  
> **Implementation Timeline:**  
> Phase 1 (First 6 months): Set up Wi-Fi hotspots and plan workshop curricula. Begin pilot workshops at one library.  
> Phase 2 (6-12 months): Expand workshops to more locations, roll out the device loan program.  
> Phase 3 (12-24 months): Solidify partnerships and incorporate digital literacy into school programs. Evaluate progress and adjust the plan as needed.  
>  
> **Conclusion:**  
> By implementing these measures, Lakeside County will take significant strides in closing the digital literacy gap. Improving digital literacy will empower residents, strengthen the workforce, and contribute to the overall well-being and economic health of the community. This proposal seeks support and funding to turn the outlined initiatives into reality, ensuring that no one in Lakeside County is left behind in the digital age.

On the surface, this output reads well. It’s organized, it covers a bunch of reasonable initiatives, and it even thought of an implementation timeline. If you had no background information at all, you might think, “This sounds pretty good.” And indeed, it’s not *bad* – the AI produced a generic template for a digital literacy policy. However, **generic is exactly the problem** here. The proposal it generated could apply to almost any county or community. It’s not specifically tailored to Lakeside County beyond the repeated mention of the name.

Notice that the AI had to make some guesses: it assumed there are rural areas with poor internet (which might be true, but we haven’t confirmed it in the prompt), it assumed libraries and community centers exist and can host workshops (likely true in general), and it suggested common solutions like Wi-Fi hotspots and device lending. These are all plausible ideas, but they were presented in a vacuum, without any real data about Lakeside County. The prompt didn’t mention what proportion of residents lack digital skills, or whether the county already has some programs in place. The AI filled in the background section with vague statements like “many individuals have limited access” and “others may not have necessary skills,” which sound right but aren’t based on specific facts – they’re boilerplate statements. 

Crucially, the output misses any *nuance*. If Lakeside County has, say, a significant number of elderly residents, you’d want the proposal to highlight training for seniors (the AI did mention seniors in passing, but only as part of a broad age-groups list). If the county’s issue is more about lack of devices than lack of broadband, or vice versa, a tailored proposal would zoom in on that. With the minimal prompt, the AI couldn’t know those things, so it gave a little bit of everything. The result is somewhat superficial. As the person responsible for this policy proposal, you now have a very skeletal draft that you’ll need to heavily edit and augment with actual county data. In fact, you might spend a lot of time replacing the generic parts with specifics – time you were hoping to save by using the AI.

This “Attempt 1” scenario highlights a key lesson: when you don’t provide detailed input, the AI can only produce a generic output. It did a decent job given the scant information, but it’s not the best you could get. You essentially got an outline that *you* will have to tailor after the fact. But what if we had given the AI the relevant details from the start? Let’s see how things improve when we apply **Exhaustive Input**.

### Attempt 2: Exhaustive Input (Getting it Right)

Determined to get a more useful draft, you decide to incorporate the wealth of background information you have on hand. Instead of leaving the AI in the dark, you will enlighten it with everything a knowledgeable human policy analyst in your county would know. This means sharing key data points and context from the *Lakeside County Digital Inclusion Assessment* report as part of your prompt.

Let’s say the background report includes findings like these (for the sake of example, we’ll summarize some hypothetical but realistic points):

- **Population and Demographics:** Lakeside County has 50,000 residents, spread across one small city and several rural towns. Approximately 18% of the population are seniors (age 65+), and many of them have limited experience with computers. There is also a significant number of low-income households in rural areas.  
- **Internet Infrastructure:** About 72% of households have high-speed internet subscriptions. The remaining 28% – largely in outlying rural communities like Riverton and Pine Hill – either have no internet or rely on spotty satellite connections. Cell phone coverage is also weak in some pockets. The county’s main internet provider has been slow to expand fiber optic lines to the less populated areas due to cost.  
- **Existing Resources:** The county library system (with branches in three towns) has small computer labs and offers basic digital literacy classes, but attendance has been low. A couple of non-profits occasionally run digital skills workshops, but there’s no coordinated county-wide program. The school district has introduced a “1-to-1 device” program (each student has a Chromebook), which has improved tech access for students, though teachers say many parents struggle to help kids with these devices due to their own low digital literacy.  
- **Identified Gaps:** According to a recent survey, about 40% of residents have difficulty performing online tasks like filling out forms or searching for jobs online. The highest need is among adults over 50 and among households in the two most remote towns. Affordability of devices and internet service is cited as a barrier by 25% of respondents. Another gap is the lack of public Wi-Fi outside the city center.  
- **Opportunities:** The report notes that a state grant for rural broadband expansion is available, which the county could apply for. Also, a local community college has expressed interest in partnering to offer adult education classes in computer skills. There’s an annual tech fair in the county that could be used to launch an awareness campaign.

Armed with these specifics, you craft a much more detailed prompt for the AI. You might write, for example:

“*You are an expert policy analyst. Draft a detailed policy proposal for improving digital literacy in Lakeside County. Use the background information provided below to make the proposal data-driven and tailored to the county’s situation.* 

**Background Information (Lakeside County):**  
- Population: 50,000; mix of one small urban center and several rural towns. 18% are seniors (65+).  
- Internet Access: 72% of households have high-speed internet; 28% (mostly rural areas) have limited or no access. Some remote towns rely on slow satellite internet; cell coverage is patchy in parts.  
- Current Programs: 3 public libraries with computer labs; basic classes offered but low attendance. Schools have improved student access (1 Chromebook per student), but many parents lack digital skills. A few nonprofits run workshops occasionally; no county-wide coordination.  
- Needs: A recent survey found ~40% of residents struggle with online tasks (forms, job applications). Greatest needs in age 50+ group and in remote towns (e.g., Riverton, Pine Hill). 25% cite cost of devices/internet as a barrier. Very limited public Wi-Fi outside main town.  
- Opportunities: State grant available for rural broadband expansion (application deadline upcoming). Local community college willing to host adult digital literacy classes. Annual county tech fair could help promote digital literacy initiatives.*”

*(And you then continue the prompt by saying: “Now, based on that background, provide the proposal.”)*

Essentially, you are feeding the AI with the exact data that a human policymaker would use to write the proposal. This is the **Exhaustive Input** strategy in action – you leave little to guesswork. The AI, equipped with these details, can now generate a proposal that speaks directly to Lakeside County’s context. Let’s look at a plausible output from this enriched prompt:

**Output (with exhaustive input):**

> **Title:** Lakeside County Digital Literacy Enhancement Proposal, 2025  
>  
> **Executive Summary:**  
> Lakeside County faces a digital divide that affects approximately one-third of its residents, particularly seniors and those in our rural communities. Only 72% of households have high-speed internet, and as many as 40% of residents report difficulties with tasks like online forms and job applications. This proposal outlines a targeted plan to improve digital literacy and internet access across the county. Key initiatives include expanding broadband to underserved areas (leveraging available state grants), establishing community-based digital skills training (with a focus on older adults and low-income families), improving public access to devices and Wi-Fi, and coordinating efforts through public-private partnerships. By addressing specific local needs – from Riverton’s connectivity gaps to senior-focused training in Pine Hill – the plan aims to ensure all residents can participate fully in the digital society.  
>  
> **Background and Needs Assessment:**  
> Lakeside County is home to about 50,000 people, with an even mix of urban and rural populations. While the county’s main town has benefited from modern internet infrastructure, outlying areas like Riverton and Pine Hill still lack reliable service. Currently, 28% of households county-wide do not have high-speed internet access【✱】. This lack of connectivity correlates with lower digital proficiency. A recent county survey found that approximately 40% of residents (mainly those over 50 and those without home internet) struggle to use online tools for essential tasks such as accessing government services, applying for jobs, or using telehealth platforms【✱】.  
>  
> The county library system and local nonprofits have made initial efforts to offer digital literacy classes. However, these programs have had limited reach and coordination. For instance, the three public libraries collectively served only a few dozen attendees in basic computer classes last year, and those sessions did not cover advanced skills like online job search or digital security. Schools have provided students with devices (Chromebooks), which is a positive step for the younger generation. Still, many parents in our communities lack the knowledge to support their children’s digital learning at home. We’ve identified a particular gap in services for seniors: with 18% of our population over 65, we have thousands of older residents who did not grow up with digital technology and who need tailored training (often starting from very basic tasks like using email or smartphones).  
>  
> **Objectives:**  
> 1. **Expand Broadband Access** – Achieve at least 90% high-speed internet coverage of households within 3 years, with a focus on currently underserved rural areas.  
> 2. **Increase Digital Literacy** – Provide practical digital skills training to at least 5,000 residents over the next 2 years, prioritizing seniors and adults in remote towns who have limited experience with technology.  
> 3. **Improve Public Access to Technology** – Ensure that every resident is within a 15-minute drive of a free internet Wi-Fi hotspot and has access to public computers or loaner devices if they cannot afford their own.  
> 4. **Foster Sustainable Partnerships** – Create a coalition of local government, schools, libraries, nonprofits, and private sector partners to coordinate digital inclusion efforts and share resources.  
>  
> **Proposed Initiatives:**  
> - **Rural Broadband Expansion:** In collaboration with the state’s broadband grant program, contract with internet service providers to extend fiber-optic or high-speed wireless service to Riverton, Pine Hill, and other underserved areas. This will involve building necessary infrastructure (towers, lines) with grant funding offsetting costs. Target completion of initial infrastructure projects within 18 months. *Metric:* Reduce the percentage of households without high-speed access from 28% to under 10%.  
>  
> - **Community Digital Literacy Centers:** Establish dedicated digital literacy hubs at existing facilities – for example, expand the computer labs at the three public libraries and set up additional centers at the community college campus and the Pine Hill community hall. These centers will offer free weekly classes and drop-in help sessions. We will hire or contract trained instructors (potentially in partnership with the community college and tech-oriented nonprofits) to run classes tailored to different needs: basic internet use and email for beginners, job search and resume workshops for job-seekers, and smartphone use and online health services for seniors, etc. *Metric:* 200 classes held in the first year across all centers; at least 2,500 total attendees.  
>  
> - **Mobile Tech Lab and Outreach:** For residents in very remote parts of the county who cannot easily travel, create a “mobile tech lab” — essentially a van equipped with laptops and a portable internet hotspot — that can visit small villages on a rotating schedule. This mobile unit will offer on-site training sessions monthly in locations like rural community halls or schools. It will also distribute easy-to-follow printed guides (and video tutorials on loanable DVDs/USBs) for self-learning. *Metric:* Mobile lab visits 8 communities per month; reaches 1,000 residents in first year.  
>  
> - **Device Access Program:** Implement a device lending program and a low-cost device purchase initiative. Libraries will lend out Wi-Fi hotspots and basic tablets/laptops (with priority for low-income households identified through an application process). In partnership with a nonprofit (for example, a refurbishing organization) or a corporate donor, facilitate a program where eligible residents can receive refurbished computers or discounted new devices. *Metric:* 500 devices distributed or lent in first year; follow-up surveys to confirm recipients are using them for online access.  
>  
> - **Public Wi-Fi Expansion:** Besides library Wi-Fi, install free Wi-Fi hotspots in areas currently lacking them. Focus on places people naturally congregate in rural towns – e.g., the central post office in Riverton, the farmers’ market grounds in Pine Hill, and outside major public buildings. This ensures that even if someone can’t afford internet at home, they can connect at these community hubs. *Metric:* 10 new public Wi-Fi hotspots operational within 12 months.  
>  
> - **Awareness and Training Campaign:** Launch an annual **“Digital Inclusion Week”** in Lakeside County, tied into the existing county tech fair. During this week, we’ll host events to promote digital literacy: workshops, tech gadget demos for beginners, and booths where people can get one-on-one help. We will also use local radio, newspapers, and social media to publicize ongoing resources—letting residents know about the new classes, the device lending, and the Wi-Fi locations. Part of the campaign will specifically target seniors (e.g., through senior centers and healthcare providers) to invite them to beginner-friendly tech workshops. *Metric:* Increase enrollment in digital literacy classes by 50% following the campaign; measure public awareness via surveys (e.g., % of residents who know about the free classes rises from baseline).  
>  
> **Partnerships and Governance:**  
> To coordinate these efforts, the proposal recommends forming a **Digital Inclusion Task Force** for the county. This task force, led by the County’s Department of Community Services, would include representatives from: the public library system, the school district, the community college, local non-profit organizations (like “Connected Rural Communities” group), and private sector partners (e.g., an ISP rep or a tech company volunteer group). The task force will meet monthly to oversee implementation, avoid duplication of efforts, and share progress. They will also handle the grant applications and manage funds for the broadband project and other initiatives. By uniting stakeholders, Lakeside County can ensure the program is sustainable and adjusts to feedback.  
>  
> **Budget and Funding:**  
> The initiatives will be funded through a combination of sources. The rural broadband expansion will largely rely on the state grant (which can cover up to 80% of infrastructure costs) and matching investments from the ISP. The county will allocate funds for the Digital Literacy Centers (primarily to upgrade facilities and pay instructors). We anticipate seeking additional micro-grants for the mobile tech lab and device refurbishments (potentially from tech foundations or federal digital inclusion funds). In-kind contributions – such as donated used computers from businesses, or volunteer trainers from the local college – will also be a valuable resource. A preliminary budget is outlined in Appendix A, with cost estimates for each initiative. For example, the device lending program might require $30,000 to purchase 100 new devices, the mobile lab could be a one-time cost of $50,000 (for the van and equipment), and so on. The task force will refine these numbers and identify funding gaps to be filled.  
>  
> **Timeline:**  
> - *Months 1-3:* Form task force, secure initial funding (submit state grant application for broadband by upcoming deadline), hire program coordinator.  
> - *Months 3-12:* Roll out broadband projects (begin infrastructure work), launch pilot classes at Digital Literacy Centers, start device lending program at main library.

> **Conclusion:**  
> Lakeside County’s digital literacy initiative is tailored to the specific challenges our residents face, from the senior in Pine Hill who has never used a computer, to the small business owner in Riverton who can’t get a reliable connection. By investing in infrastructure, education, and community partnerships, we will bridge the digital divide in our county. This proposal not only outlines a path to greater digital inclusion over the next few years, but also establishes a framework to sustain these efforts long-term. With committed leadership and the utilization of available resources (like the state broadband grant and local expertise), Lakeside County can become a model for how rural counties thrive in the digital era. We respectfully submit this proposal for approval and funding, confident that it will empower our citizens and strengthen our community as a whole.

Wow – notice the transformation! The structure of the output is similar (it’s still a policy proposal with introduction, objectives, actions, etc.), but the content is **much more specific and actionable**. The AI was able to weave in the details provided: it cited the exact percentage of households without internet (28%), the survey statistic (40% struggling with online tasks), and it tailored initiatives to the named communities (Riverton and Pine Hill) that were identified as needing help. It also incorporated the fact that seniors are a big part of the issue, by detailing senior-focused training and outreach through healthcare channels and senior centers. The mention of a state grant and a community college partnership directly came from the background info we provided – the AI didn’t randomly invent those, it used what we gave it. Even the budget section references realistic numbers and sources of funding, which were only possible because the prompt noted there was a state grant and need for devices, etc.

This output is far closer to what you, as the civil servant, would want in a first draft. It’s actually *useful*. You could take this and present it (after a bit of polishing) as a solid plan. The difference is night and day compared to the first attempt. In Attempt 1, we got a cookie-cutter plan that we’d have to customize heavily. In Attempt 2, we got a customized plan that clearly was built around Lakeside’s facts and figures.

A few things to highlight from this comparison:

- **The AI followed the lead of the data.** Because we fed it the survey results and the precise problem areas, it did not waste time on issues that weren’t relevant. For example, the first draft in Attempt 1 talked about generic solutions like partnerships and awareness in a broad way. In the second draft, partnerships are specifically linked to forming a task force and including particular local entities; awareness efforts are tied to the existing tech fair event. Those concrete touches make the proposal credible.

- **No Hallucinated Facts:** In the detailed output, every statistic or specific claim can be traced back to the input we gave. The model didn’t have to guess percentages or make up which towns have needs – we told it, and it stuck to those. This reduces the risk of inaccuracies. If a stakeholder asks “Where did this 40% figure come from?”, you know it came from your provided data, not from the AI’s imagination.

- **Nuanced Strategy:** By knowing the *why* behind the digital literacy gap (e.g., cost barriers for some, lack of infrastructure for others), the AI suggested a multi-pronged solution that addresses those nuances: infrastructure for connectivity, training for skills, device programs for affordability, etc. In contrast, the minimal input version didn’t have the nuance, so it just scattershot various generic ideas without knowing which ones mattered most.

- **Reusability of Input:** Another benefit worth noting – once you’ve compiled that background info (the county assessment data) into your prompt, you essentially have a reusable knowledge packet. If tomorrow you need the AI to write a grant application for funding this digital literacy project, you can use the same background details in that new prompt. Or if you want to draft a press release about the initiative, again you plug in the same context. Providing exhaustive input might take a bit more effort upfront (typing or pasting in the details), but it pays off across multiple uses. You don’t have to keep re-explaining the situation; you have it ready to go. In a way, you’ve created a mini knowledge base about Lakeside County that the AI can draw from whenever you need to generate related documents.

- **Confidence and Tone:** Notice that the second output reads as if it was written by someone who really knows Lakeside County – which, of course, was because the AI was given the perspective of someone who does. This lends an authoritative tone to the writing. The first output was fine in tone, but generic text can sometimes come across as less convincing (“the county recognizes the importance…” versus specific data-driven statements). When you fill the prompt with real context, the model’s writing will naturally reflect that context’s importance, making the output more persuasive to readers who care about those specifics.

The example above underscores the power of the **Exhaustive Input** pattern. By providing full context, we guided the model to produce a far superior result. The AI could only do so because we essentially gave it the same information a knowledgeable human writer would have. It didn’t have to fill in blanks with one-size-fits-all content.

For you as an AI user, the takeaway is clear: whenever you’re asking for something complex or detailed, pause and ask yourself, “Am I giving the AI everything it needs to know?” If not, gather that info and include it. It could be background facts like in our policy scenario, or perhaps previous outputs or user preferences in other scenarios. Sometimes this means doing a little homework – for instance, pulling up a relevant report or statistics – but that work is worth it. You feed it all in, and the model will integrate those details into the answer. The more you load the dice in your favor with context, the less the model has to roll the dice to guess what you want.

In practice, using **Exhaustive Input** might feel like writing a brief or assembling an appendix for your query. It is extra effort up front, but it almost always saves you time on the back end. Instead of iterating multiple times with the AI (“Oh, I should mention this detail… now the output is a bit better, but still missing that other piece…”), you hit it once with everything and get a high-quality answer in one go. And as we saw, once you have that comprehensive input prepared, you can often reuse it for future prompts on related tasks, creating a consistent and rich context each time.

To conclude, **Exhaustive Input** is about not leaving important information to chance. When you provide plentiful, relevant context, you unlock the full potential of the LLM to generate insightful, accurate, and context-specific results. As models get more capable of handling large amounts of text, the bottleneck increasingly becomes **how well the user can supply the right information**. Master this pattern, and you’ll find your AI partner becomes significantly more effective – producing outputs that feel as if it truly understands your unique scenario, because in effect, you’ve empowered it with the knowledge it needs.
