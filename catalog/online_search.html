<p>Allow the LLM to search online for extra information.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The LLM&#x2019;s built-in knowledge may be outdated or incomplete, especially for recent events or highly specific queries. Without access to current or external information, the model might give answers that are missing important facts or context. Relying solely on the LLM&#x2019;s training data can be limiting when a question depends on up-to-date data or niche information not covered in its training. In short, users are motivated to use this pattern whenever they realize the LLM alone might not have the <strong>latest</strong> or most <strong>specific</strong> information needed.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Enable or instruct the LLM to perform an online search (or consult external data sources) as part of the prompt. If the platform allows, you can explicitly tell the model to gather information from the internet to supplement its answer. For instance, your prompt might say, <em>&#x201C;First, search for the latest statistics on X, then use them to answer the question.&#x201D;</em> By doing this, the LLM can retrieve and incorporate relevant, up-to-date information that improves the accuracy and completeness of its response. In practice, this often means breaking your task into two phases: <strong>search</strong> for information first, then <strong>analyze</strong> or use that information in the answer.</p>
<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
<p>Why do we need to let an LLM search online in the first place? The core challenge is that an LLM, by itself, is a bit like a very knowledgeable person who has been cut off from the news. It knows a lot from its training, but its knowledge has a cutoff date and gaps. This creates several issues for everyday users:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Knowledge:</strong> Most LLMs have a knowledge cutoff&#x2014;meaning they don&#x2019;t know anything beyond a certain date. For example, if you ask who the current British monarch is, a model trained only on data up to 2021 might confidently answer <em>&#x201C;Queen Elizabeth II,&#x201D;</em> not knowing that she passed away in 2022 and was succeeded by King Charles III. In a fast-changing world, this is a big problem. A civil servant or NGO staffer working on a 2025 report can&#x2019;t rely on an answer that might have been true in 2021 but is now out-of-date. Without an online search, the LLM might provide obsolete information that could embarrass the user or lead to poor decisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Missing Specifics:</strong> Even when the information isn&#x2019;t super new, it might be very specific or niche &#x2014; the kind of detail that wasn&#x2019;t common or notable enough to appear in the LLM&#x2019;s training data. Imagine an educator trying to get details about a small pilot program in a remote region, or a nonprofit professional looking for the exact wording of a recently updated policy. If that information wasn&#x2019;t widely published before the LLM&#x2019;s knowledge cutoff, the model might respond with a generic answer or say it doesn&#x2019;t know. In many cases, the model might <strong>attempt</strong> an answer based on what it <em>does</em> know (perhaps similar policies or older data), but the result will lack the precise detail the user needs. The absence of specific, up-to-date information can make an LLM&#x2019;s output less useful or even unusable for tasks like detailed reports or timely content creation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Hallucinated Answers:</strong> When an LLM doesn&#x2019;t have access to real data on a topic, it may try to fill the gap by generating an answer that sounds plausible &#x2014; essentially, it can hallucinate. This isn&#x2019;t the LLM trying to lie; it&#x2019;s just predicting an answer based on patterns it learned, even if that answer isn&#x2019;t grounded in fact. For instance, if a writer asks an LLM (with no web access) for <em>&#x201C;the latest statistics on global electric car sales,&#x201D;</em> the model might produce some numbers that look right but are completely made-up or taken from an earlier year. Likewise, an NGO employee might request, <em>&#x201C;List recent statements from the UN Secretary-General on climate finance,&#x201D;</em> and an LLM without updated data might invent a quote or cite an older statement from years ago as if it were recent. These hallucinations can be dangerous &#x2014; a well-meaning user might take them as truth. Without verification, incorrect information could slip into a policy memo, educational material, or public speech.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of User Awareness:</strong> A subtle but important challenge is that non-technical users might <strong>not realize</strong> when the LLM is giving outdated or invented information. If you&#x2019;re not aware of the model&#x2019;s knowledge cutoff or its tendency to bluff when unsure, you might assume every answer is accurate. Consider a teacher preparing a handout: if she asks the LLM about a recent scientific discovery and gets a confidently written answer, she might include it verbatim, unaware that the model&#x2019;s answer was based on old info or guesswork. This can erode trust in the tool once the mistake comes to light &#x2014; for example, students might point out that the &#x201C;latest research&#x201D; mentioned is actually several years old. The user&#x2019;s credibility suffers due to an innocent trust in the AI. This pattern (&#x201C;Online Search&#x201D;) is motivated by the need to bridge that gap and give the user a way to get <strong>real, current information</strong> rather than relying on the LLM&#x2019;s possibly stale memory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All the above challenges boil down to one thing: if the LLM doesn&#x2019;t <strong>know</strong> something from its training, it can&#x2019;t magically give a correct, up-to-date answer. Either it will admit it doesn&#x2019;t know (best case), or it will produce an answer that might be incomplete or incorrect (worst case). Neither is ideal when you&#x2019;re trying to get real work done with an AI assistant. For many professionals, the whole point of using an LLM is to save time and get quality output. Having to double-check everything it says &#x2014; or worse, missing a mistake &#x2014; can negate those benefits.</p>
<p>Online search capability addresses these issues by turning the LLM from a static encyclopedia into a dynamic research assistant. However, <strong>using</strong> that capability effectively comes with its own small set of challenges. Not every LLM or platform has a built-in search tool, so the user must know when and how to invoke it. Even when search is available, simply saying &#x201C;search about X&#x201D; and getting an answer in one step might not work smoothly. Sometimes the model might mix the tasks (searching and writing) in a confusing way or provide a disorganized answer if it tries to do everything at once. Users have found that a straightforward query like, <em>&#x201C;Find information on the new environmental law and summarize its key points,&#x201D;</em> can produce spotty results &#x2014; maybe the model gives a couple of points from one source and misses others, or it cites something irrelevant because it didn&#x2019;t search broadly enough.</p>
<p>To overcome this, a bit of technique is needed (which we&#x2019;ll explore in the Example section). The bottom line of the challenge is: <strong>how do we get accurate, current, specific information into our prompts?</strong> Recognizing the limitations above is the first step. It sets the stage for the solution &#x2014; allowing the LLM to go out and fetch the information we need, rather than expecting it to already know everything. For an everyday user, understanding this pattern is empowering. It&#x2019;s the difference between working with an isolated, book-smart assistant versus an assistant who can use the internet as a library on demand. Once you see the pitfalls of a closed-book LLM, the benefit of opening that book to the latest chapter (through an online search) becomes clear.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let&#x2019;s illustrate how <strong>Online Search</strong> can be applied in practice with a couple of realistic scenarios. We&#x2019;ll walk through how a user can prompt an LLM to first retrieve information via search and then use it, separating the process into clear steps. Along the way, we&#x2019;ll highlight some techniques to avoid pitfalls like hallucinated links or paywalled content. These examples are fictitious but representative of real situations that educators, NGO professionals, and writers face.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-1-ngo-leader-prepares-a-timely-speech">Scenario 1: NGO Leader Prepares a Timely Speech</h3>
<p>Imagine an NGO leader preparing a speech in response to a very recent event. Let&#x2019;s say a major AI company has just released a new advanced language model that&#x2019;s making headlines this week. She wants to mention this development in her speech and discuss its implications for her field. If she asks a standard LLM (with no internet access) about this new model, she might hit a wall &#x2014; the LLM might not know it exists and could respond with <em>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not aware of that development&#x201D;</em> or give a generic answer about AI models. Instead, she decides to apply the Online Search pattern to get the latest facts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Instruct the LLM to search for information.</strong> She begins by explicitly prompting the LLM to gather up-to-date info: <em>&#x201C;Please search the internet for the recent announcement about Company X&#x2019;s new language model and find key details such as its name, key features, and any notable reactions or quotes from experts.&#x201D;</em> This prompt makes it clear that the AI&#x2019;s first task is <strong>not</strong> to write the speech, but to act as a research assistant. Some LLM platforms have a special mode or plugin for web browsing; others might require a more manual approach (where the AI tells <em>you</em> what to search). In this case, assume she&#x2019;s using an AI assistant that can indeed go online when asked. The LLM then performs the search and (after a few moments) returns with a summary of findings. For example, it might come back with a list of bullet points or a short report like: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>LLM (Search Results Summary):</strong><br>&#x2013; <em>Company X announced the release of its new model &#x201C;XYZ-2&#x201D; on April 10, 2025.</em><br>&#x2013; <em>XYZ-2 is reported to have significantly improved conversational abilities, passing several difficult language benchmarks.</em><br>&#x2013; <em>Experts in the field, like Dr. Jane Smith, are noting that this could boost AI-assisted education and customer service.</em><br>&#x2013; <em>Some commentators are cautious, mentioning concerns about bias and the need for transparency.</em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this hypothetical output, the LLM has pulled together the key points from one or more news articles about the event. Notice that it includes specific details (the model&#x2019;s name, the date of announcement) and even a quote or reference to an expert&#x2019;s reaction. This is information the LLM didn&#x2019;t originally &#x201C;know&#x201D; before the search &#x2014; it learned it just now, by retrieving it. The NGO leader now has <strong>fresh, relevant data</strong> to work with.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Instruct the LLM to use the gathered information.</strong> With the latest facts in hand, the user&#x2019;s next prompt builds the speech. She might say: <em>&#x201C;Great, now using the information you found, draft a 5-minute speech that I can give to our team. The speech should introduce the new AI model and discuss one or two implications it might have for our NGO&#x2019;s work. Please incorporate the key facts (name, date, expert opinion) you found, and cite who said the quote.&#x201D;</em> This prompt tells the LLM exactly what to do with the research: integrate it into a coherent piece of writing (the speech), and even includes a requirement to cite the expert for credibility.</p>
<p>By separating the tasks, the user makes it easier for the LLM to focus. In the first step, the model wasn&#x2019;t trying to be eloquent or persuasive &#x2014; it was just gathering and summarizing facts. In the second step, it can concentrate on writing a good speech, since the raw material is already there. This division of labor tends to produce better results than asking the model to do everything in one go, like <em>&#x201C;Find info on X and write a speech about it.&#x201D;</em> In a one-shot attempt, the LLM might have gotten some facts right and mixed others up, or it might have been too vague. By doing research first, then writing, the content of the speech is now grounded in actual data the model retrieved.</p>
<p>As the LLM writes the speech, it will likely say something like, <em>&#x201C;Just last week, on April 10, 2025, Company X unveiled a new language model called XYZ-2 that sets a new benchmark for AI conversations&#x2026;&#x201D;</em> and go on to weave in the expert&#x2019;s comment, e.g., <em>&#x201C;Dr. Jane Smith, a leading AI researcher, commented that this development could significantly boost AI-assisted education and customer service.&#x201D;</em> The NGO leader listens to the draft and finds it accurate and contextually relevant &#x2014; much better than what she would have gotten if the model had been unaware of the latest news. She does a quick double-check: she ensures that the facts mentioned (dates, names) match what was in the summary. She also verifies that Dr. Jane Smith is a real expert and that the quote is correctly attributed (because she explicitly asked for information, the chances of a made-up quote are lower, but it&#x2019;s a good habit to verify). Satisfied, she now has a solid speech draft, courtesy of the Online Search pattern. What&#x2019;s more, she saved herself the time of manually looking up articles &#x2014; the AI did it for her, and she could focus on shaping the message.</p>
<p>Before moving to the next example, let&#x2019;s reflect on a couple of important safeguards the NGO leader used (and that <strong>you</strong> should use too when applying this pattern):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No Fake Links or Sources:</strong> In her prompts, she didn&#x2019;t just say &#x201C;find info&#x201D; &#x2014; she implicitly expected real information. If she had asked for direct links or references, she would also need to instruct the LLM <strong>not to fabricate</strong> them. It&#x2019;s worth noting that LLMs sometimes produce official-looking links or citations that don&#x2019;t actually exist, especially if asked to provide sources. A good practice is to say something like, <em>&#x201C;Provide the title of the article and the source, but don&#x2019;t make up any URL or reference. If you&#x2019;re not sure, just say you couldn&#x2019;t find it.&#x201D;</em> This explicitly warns the AI not to fill in the blanks with fake data. In our example, the AI returned a summary with enough detail that the user can search those details herself if needed (for instance, she can independently verify Company X&#x2019;s press release or Dr. Smith&#x2019;s quote). Always remember: <strong>double-check key facts.</strong> Online Search gives you access to up-to-date info, but you should still verify critical details from the original sources when possible, especially before publishing or presenting the content.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Awareness of Paywalls and Access Limits:</strong> In the scenario above, the LLM was able to pull information from news articles. But what if the most relevant article was behind a paywall or required login? Today&#x2019;s LLM search tools can&#x2019;t magically bypass paywalls. In such cases, the AI might return a partial snippet (e.g., the first paragraph available for free) or just note that the content isn&#x2019;t fully accessible. As a user, you should be aware of this limitation. In our example, if the best source about &#x201C;XYZ-2&#x201D; was a paywalled piece in a magazine, the AI&#x2019;s summary might miss some details that were locked behind that wall. The NGO leader would then need to find an alternate source (maybe a press release or a different news site covering the story) or access the article herself through a subscription. There isn&#x2019;t a perfect solution for this yet &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a limitation of the technology. The pattern still helps because the AI could at least inform you that <em>&#x201C;an article exists in X Magazine about this, but full content couldn&#x2019;t be retrieved.&#x201D;</em> That hint is better than being completely unaware of the source. The key takeaway is to remain flexible: sometimes the AI might give you the heads-up about a source, and you&#x2019;ll decide to retrieve it yourself if it&#x2019;s important.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scenario-2-teacher-updates-a-lesson-with-current-information">Scenario 2: Teacher Updates a Lesson with Current Information</h3>
<p>For a second scenario, let&#x2019;s consider a high school teacher who is updating her lesson plan for a current events class. She wants to include information about a recent international climate summit that took place this year. In the past, she might have spent a couple of hours combing through news articles and official summaries to get the highlights of the summit. With an AI assistant, she hopes to speed up this process. However, she knows her AI&#x2019;s knowledge might not include the details of something that just happened last month. So, she uses the Online Search pattern to get what she needs efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Searching for specific facts and figures.</strong> The teacher prompts her LLM: <em>&#x201C;Search for the key outcomes of the 2025 International Climate Summit and list the main points (for example, any major agreements, targets set, or quotes from leaders).&#x201D;</em> Here she is very specific about what to look for. The model goes off to search the web. After a short while, it returns with a concise list of findings, perhaps like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>LLM (Search Results Summary):</strong><br>&#x2013; <em>Over 100 countries pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, with an agreement signed on renewable energy funding.</em><br>&#x2013; <em>A new climate finance mechanism was announced, with developed countries agreeing to contribute $100 billion annually to support developing nations.</em><br>&#x2013; <em>The summit&#x2019;s closing statement included a quote from the UN Secretary-General emphasizing urgency: &#x201C;We are approaching the point of no return, but it is not too late.&#x201D;</em><br>&#x2013; <em>Some environmental groups criticized the summit for lacking enforcement measures despite the ambitious pledges.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives the teacher exactly the raw material she was looking for: up-to-date, relevant points from the event, including a powerful quote she might use to spark discussion in class. Notably, if she had tried to rely on the LLM without search, she likely wouldn&#x2019;t get this level of detail or accuracy. At best, the model might have talked about <em>previous</em> climate summits or general climate change facts. At worst, it could have made an incorrect guess about what happened at the 2025 summit. By instructing it to search, she now has current details she can trust (but again, she will verify any crucial numbers like that $100 billion figure, just to be certain it&#x2019;s correct).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Creating the lesson content using the new information.</strong> Next, the teacher uses the info to update her lesson plan. She might say to the LLM: <em>&#x201C;Using the points you found, draft two paragraphs suitable for my lesson handout: one paragraph summarizing the outcomes of the 2025 Climate Summit, and another paragraph describing different perspectives on those outcomes (for instance, positive reactions and criticisms).&#x201D;</em> The LLM then produces a draft. Thanks to the search results, the draft paragraph can include specifics like, <em>&#x201C;In 2025, over 100 countries at the International Climate Summit pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, committing significant funding toward renewable energy. A new climate finance mechanism will channel $100 billion annually from developed to developing nations to aid in green initiatives&#x2026;&#x201D;</em> and so on. The following paragraph might say something like, <em>&#x201C;Reactions to the summit&#x2019;s outcomes were mixed. Global leaders and the UN Secretary-General hailed the agreements as a critical step forward, with remarks emphasizing that &#x2018;we are approaching the point of no return, but it is not too late.&#x2019; However, environmental advocacy groups argued that the pledges lacked concrete enforcement mechanisms, calling the promises &#x2018;ambitious but toothless&#x2019; in the absence of legal binding measures&#x2026;&#x201D;</em>.</p>
<p>The teacher reviews these paragraphs. They closely match what she might have written herself after reading a few articles &#x2014; except it took her only a couple of well-crafted prompts and a few minutes of waiting. She ensures the quote is correctly attributed and perhaps adds the name of the UN Secretary-General to the text (if the AI omitted it). She&#x2019;s careful to double-check the net-zero pledge detail and the finance figure against a reputable source, maybe quickly skimming an official press release or a trusted news outlet, just to be 100% sure the AI got it right from the web. Everything checks out. With minimal edits, she incorporates these paragraphs into her handout. Thanks to the Online Search pattern, her lesson material is timely and accurate, and she saved precious time in preparation.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Prompting Tips:</strong> In the above example, notice how the teacher&#x2019;s prompts were phrased. They exemplify a few best practices when using the Online Search pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Be specific about what to search for:</em> She mentioned &#x201C;key outcomes&#x201D; and even gave examples (agreements, targets, quotes) to guide the AI. This helps the model focus on retrieving exactly the kind of information she wants.</li>
<li><em>Separate listing facts from writing narrative:</em> First, she got a list of points (facts). Then, she asked for a narrative write-up. This separation ensures the factual information is gathered without the distraction of trying to form polished prose simultaneously.</li>
<li><em>Incorporate context in the second prompt:</em> When asking to draft the paragraphs, she reminded the AI of the perspective needed (for a lesson handout) and specifically asked for mention of different reactions. This contextual guidance helps the AI use the information correctly and in a balanced way.</li>
<li><em>Verify critical info:</em> Even though the AI did the searching, she double-checked important numbers and quotes. This step cannot be overstated &#x2013; it&#x2019;s a safety net to catch any possible misinterpretation the AI might have made when summarizing sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these practices, users can get the most out of the Online Search pattern while minimizing errors. </p>
<h3 id="wrapping-up-the-pattern">Wrapping Up the Pattern</h3>
<p>Both scenarios above show the power of augmenting an LLM&#x2019;s abilities with online search. We saw how an NGO leader could confidently address a breaking development in her field, and how a teacher could keep her curriculum up-to-date with the latest information &#x2013; tasks that would have been difficult or impossible with the LLM&#x2019;s built-in knowledge alone. The pattern transforms the LLM from just a static knowledge responder into an active information gatherer and processor.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s worth mentioning that advanced AI setups sometimes use a similar idea called <em>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</em>, where the model automatically retrieves information from a dedicated database or knowledge base to answer questions. In essence, that&#x2019;s like an <strong>offline</strong> version of online search &#x2013; pulling in facts from a library of documents rather than the open internet. RAG and related techniques are beyond our scope here, but they share the same motivation: combining an LLM&#x2019;s language skills with up-to-date information retrieval. The takeaway for everyday users is that you don&#x2019;t necessarily need a special system &#x2013; with the right prompting techniques, you can achieve a lot of this yourself using a general-purpose LLM and internet access.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <strong>Online Search</strong> is a pattern that addresses a fundamental limitation of LLMs by giving them the ability to fetch fresh knowledge. For non-technical users, the practical benefits are immediate: more accurate answers, content that reflects the latest reality, and fewer embarrassing mistakes from outdated info. The key is to remember to guide the AI through the search-and-summarize process, rather than assuming it knows everything. Treat your AI assistant as an eager student with a vast library at its fingertips &#x2013; it can find the answer, but only if you tell it to go look. Using Online Search, you ensure that both you and the LLM are working with the best information available, leading to outputs that are not only correct, but also relevant and compelling.</p>
