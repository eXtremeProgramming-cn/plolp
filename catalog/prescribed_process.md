### Prescribed Process  
Outline steps to ensure thoroughness and adherence to the required workflow.

**Challenge:** For complex tasks involving research, analysis, or synthesis, the LLM might take shortcuts, skip crucial steps, or use a suboptimal approach. This can lead to incomplete or inaccurate results when the process isn't carefully guided.

**Solution:** Outline a specific process or sequence of steps for the LLM to follow. This can include:  
- **Sequenced actions:** Provide numbered or bulleted instructions for sequential actions (e.g., "1. Read the case study... 2. Analyze the data... 3. Draft the summary...").  
- **Information to gather:** Specify the types of information to collect or consider at each stage (e.g., "a. Review other reports on the topic, b. Summarize background information, c. Relate findings to China's national interest").  
- **Reference materials:** Refer to external documents or guides for additional methodology (e.g., "Follow the steps outlined in Section 5 'Problem Orientation' of the attached guide").  
- **Checkpoints:** Pose questions for the LLM to answer during the process to ensure all aspects are covered.
