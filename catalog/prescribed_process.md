## Prescribed Process / Guided Methodology

*   **Intent:** To guide the LLM through a specific sequence of steps or a defined methodology to accomplish a complex task, ensuring thoroughness and adherence to a required workflow.
*   **Problem:** For complex tasks involving research, analysis, and synthesis, the LLM might take shortcuts, miss crucial steps, or use a suboptimal approach, leading to incomplete or inaccurate results.
*   **Solution:** Outline the specific steps or methodology the LLM must follow. This can include:
    *   Numbered or bulleted instructions for sequential actions (e.g., "1) Read..., 2) Browse..., 3) Compose...").
    *   Specific types of information to gather or consider (e.g., "a) Other reports..., b) Background info..., c) China's national interest...").
    *   Reference to external documents detailing the process (e.g., "follow the guidance of Section 4," "follow Section 5 'Problem Orientation'," "follow Section 6 'Data Collection Methodology'").
    *   Questions to answer during the process (e.g., Problem Orientation questions in Prompt 2).
*   **Applicability:** Use for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, report generation, data analysis, complex problem-solving, or any task where the *how* is as important as the *what*. Seen clearly in all three prompts.
