## Who am I?

I'm a writer in the domain of technology and software engineering.

## Context

- I'm going to write a book named as "Pattern Language of LLM Prompting".
- I'd like to imitate the writing style of the book <refactoring> written by Martin Fowler.
- I'd like to employ LLMs for content generation of the new book <Pattern Language of LLM Prompting>, rather than write it word by word. Which means I need to have a strong enough prompt to generate the content.

## Target

- I need to have a prompt for LLMs to guide the writing of my new book <Pattern Language of LLM Prompting> .

## How to achive this goal?

- Read the book <refactoring> thoroughly
- Summarize and extract the essence of the writting style of this book
- Transform these understandings into a prompt for LLM to guide the writing of my new book <Pattern Language of LLM Prompting>
